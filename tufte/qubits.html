<div id="composing-quantum-operations" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Composing quantum operations</h2>
<p>In order to understand something in its full complexity it is always good to start with the simplest case.
Let us take a closer look at quantum interference in the simplest possible computing machine: the one that has only two distinguishable configurations — two quantum states — which we label as <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>.
We prepare the machine in some input state, usually <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span>, and let it <strong>evolve</strong>: the machine undergoes a prescribed sequence of computational steps, each of which induces transitions between the two “computational states”, <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>.
The machine then ends in the output state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle=\alpha_0|0\rangle+\alpha_1|1\rangle\)</span>, meaning the two outputs, <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>, are reached with probability amplitudes <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span>, respectively.
In the process of computation each computational step <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> (also referred to as an <strong>operation</strong>) sends state <span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle\)</span> to state <span class="math inline">\(|l\rangle\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k,l=0,1\)</span>, but only with some <strong>amplitude</strong> <span class="math inline">\(U_{lk}\)</span>.
We write this as
<span class="math display" id="eq:pulsemap">\[\begin{equation}
  |k\rangle \mapsto \sum_l U_{lk} |l\rangle.
\tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
(watch out for the order of the indices).</p>
<p>Thus any computational step <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> of this machine can be described by a matrix which tabulates all the transition amplitudes:
<span class="math display">\[
  U =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    U_{00} &amp; U_{01}
  \\U_{10} &amp; U_{11}
  \end{bmatrix}.
\]</span>
The matrix element <span class="math inline">\(U_{lk}\)</span> represents the amplitude of transition from state <span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle\)</span> to state <span class="math inline">\(|l\rangle\)</span> (again, watch the order of indices).
To be clear, the entries in this matrix are not any random complex numbers: their moduli squared represent transition probabilities, which in turn implies that such matrices must be <strong>unitary</strong>.<label for="tufte-sn-22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">22</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-22" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">22</span> Recall that matrix <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is called <strong>unitary</strong> if <span class="math display">\[U^\dagger U = UU^\dagger = \operatorname{id}\]</span> where the <strong>adjoint</strong> or <strong>Hermitian conjugate</strong> <span class="math inline">\(U^\dagger\)</span> of any matrix <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> with complex entries <span class="math inline">\(U_{ij}\)</span> is obtained by taking the complex conjugate of every element in the matrix and then interchanging rows and columns (<span class="math inline">\(U^\dagger_{kl}= U^\star_{lk}\)</span>).</span></p>
<p>We can also describe <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> by drawing a diagram, which contains exactly the same information as the matrix representation, but just in a different form:</p>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="336"  style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now how can we find some quantum interference to study?
Consider two computational steps, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>.
What is the amplitude that input <span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle\)</span> will generate output <span class="math inline">\(|m\rangle\)</span>?
We have to check all computational paths leading from input <span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle\)</span> to output <span class="math inline">\(|m\rangle\)</span> and add the corresponding amplitudes.
For example, as you can see in Figure <a href="qubits.html#fig:composition-of-two-computation-steps">2.1</a>, input <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and output <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> are connected by the two computational paths: <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\mapsto|0\rangle\mapsto|1\rangle\)</span> (amplitude <span class="math inline">\(V_{10}U_{00}\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\mapsto|1\rangle\mapsto|1\rangle\)</span> (amplitude <span class="math inline">\(V_{11}U_{10}\)</span>).
Thus the total amplitude that input <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> gives output <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> is the sum <span class="math inline">\(V_{10}U_{00}+V_{11}U_{10}\)</span>, and when we take the modulus squared of this expression we will see the interference term.</p>

<div class="figure fullwidth"><span id="fig:composition-of-two-computation-steps"></span>
<img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/composition-of-two-computation-steps-1.png" alt="The composition of two computational steps, \(U\) and \(V\), with the possible paths from \(|0\rangle\) to \(|1\rangle\) highlighted." width="672"  />
<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 2.1: The composition of two computational steps, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, with the possible paths from <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> highlighted.
</p>
</div>
<p>In general, given <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    |k\rangle
    &amp;\mapsto
    \sum_l U_{lk}|l\rangle
  \\|l\rangle
    &amp;\mapsto
    \sum_m V_{ml}|m\rangle
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
we can compose the two operations: we first apply <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, and then <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, to obtain
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    |k\rangle
    &amp;\mapsto
    \sum_l U_{lk} \left(
      \sum_m V_{ml}|m\rangle
    \right)
  \\&amp;=
    \sum_m \left(
      \sum_l V_{ml}U_{lk}
    \right) |m\rangle
  \\&amp;=
    \sum_m (VU)_{mk} |m\rangle.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>If you want to hone your quantum intuition think about it the following way.
The amplitude that input <span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle\)</span> evolves to <span class="math inline">\(|m\rangle\)</span> via a specific intermediate state <span class="math inline">\(|l\rangle\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(V_{ml}U_{lk}\)</span> (evolutions are independent so the amplitudes are multiplied).
This done, we have to sum over all possible values of <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> (the transition can occur in several mutually exclusive ways so the amplitudes are added) to obtain <span class="math inline">\(\sum_l V_{ml}U_{lk}\)</span>.
Thus the matrix multiplication <span class="math inline">\(VU\)</span> (watch the order of matrices) in one swoop takes care of multiplication and addition of amplitudes corresponding to different computational paths.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Quantum bits, called “qubits”</h2>
<p>A two-state machine that we have just described in abstract terms is usually realised as a controlled evolution of a two state system, called a quantum bit or a qubit.
For example, state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> may be chosen to be the lowest energy state of an atom, the <strong>ground state</strong>, and state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> a higher energy state, the <strong>excited state</strong>.
Pulses of light of appropriate frequency, duration and intensity can take the atom back and forth between the basis states <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> (implementing logical <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{NOT}\)</span>).</p>

<!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<p>Some other pulses, say, half the duration or intensity will take the atom into states that have no classical analogue.
Such states are called <strong>coherent superpositions</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>, and represent a qubit in state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> with some amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_0\)</span> and in state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> with some other amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span>.
This is conveniently represented by a state vector
<span class="math display">\[
    |\psi\rangle =
    \alpha_0|0\rangle + \alpha_1|1\rangle

<p>A <strong>qubit</strong> is a quantum system in which the Boolean states <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> are represented by a prescribed pair of normalised and mutually orthogonal quantum states labelled as <span class="math inline">\(\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}\)</span>.
The two states form a so-called <strong>computational</strong> (or <strong>standard</strong>) basis, and so any other state of an isolated qubit can be written as a coherent superposition

It modifies the state of the qubit as

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Quantum gates and circuits</h2>
<p>Atoms, trapped ions, molecules, nuclear spins and many other quantum objects, which we call qubits, can be used to implement simple quantum interference, and hence simple quantum computation.
There is no need to learn about physics behind these diverse technologies if all you want is to understand the basics of quantum computation.
We may now conveniently forget about any specific experimental realisation of a qubit and just remember that any manipulations on qubits have to be performed by physically admissible operations, and that such operations are represented by unitary transformations.</p>
<div class="idea">
<p>A <strong>quantum (logic) gate</strong> is a device which performs a fixed unitary operation on selected qubits in a fixed period of time, and a <strong>quantum circuit</strong> is a device consisting of quantum logic gates whose computational steps are synchronised in time.
The <strong>sizes</strong> of the circuit is the number of gates it contains.</p>
</div>
<p>Some unitary <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> acting on a single qubit is represented diagrammatically as</p>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="240"  style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This diagram should be read from left to right.
The horizontal line represents a qubit that is inertly carried from one quantum operation to another.
We often call this line a <strong>quantum wire</strong>.
The wire may describe translation in space (e.g. atoms travelling through cavities) or translation in time (e.g. a sequence of operations performed on a trapped ion).
A sequence of two gates acting on the same qubit, say <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> followed by <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, is represented by</p>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="240"  style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p>You will see it over and over again, for it is quantum interference that gives quantum computation additional capabilities.
The product of the three matrices <span class="math inline">\(HP_\varphi H\)</span> describes the action of the whole circuit: it gives the transition amplitudes between states <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> at the input and the output as
<span class="math display">\[
  e^{i\frac{\varphi}{2}}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos\varphi/2 &amp; -i\sin\varphi/2
  \\-i\sin\varphi/2 &amp; \cos\varphi/2

  \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}

  \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1
  \\1 &amp; -1
  \end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>Given that our input state is almost always <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span>, it is sometimes much easier and more instructive to step through the execution of this circuit and follow the evolving state.
The interference circuit effects the following sequence of transformations:<label for="tufte-sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">24</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-24" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">24</span> We ignore the global phase factor <span class="math inline">\(e^{i\frac{\varphi}{2}}\)</span>.</span>

  \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \left(

  \right)
  \overset{H}{\longmapsto}
  \cos\frac{\phi}{2}|0\rangle - i\sin\frac{\phi}{2}|1\rangle.
\]</span>
The first Hadamard gate prepares an equally weighted superposition of <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> and the second one closes the interference by bringing the interfering paths together.
The phase shift <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> effectively controls the evolution and determines the output.
The probabilities of finding the qubit in state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> at the output are, respectively,
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \Pr(0) &amp;= \cos^2\frac{\phi}{2}
  \\\Pr(1) &amp;= \sin^2\frac{\phi}{2}.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
This simple quantum process contains, in a nutshell, the essential ingredients of quantum computation.
This sequence (Hadamard – phase shift – Hadamard) will appear over and over again.
It reflects a natural progression of quantum computation: first we prepare different computational paths, then we evaluate a function which effectively introduces phase shifts into different computational paths, then we bring the computational paths together at the output.</p>

<p>Now that we have poked our heads into the quantum world, let us see how quantum interference challenges conventional logic.
Consider a following task: design a logic gate that operates on a single bit and such that when it is followed by another, identical, logic gate the output is always the negation of the input.
Let us call this logic gate <strong>the square root of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{NOT}\)</span></strong>, or <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\texttt{NOT}}\)</span>.</p>

<p>A simple check, such as an attempt to construct a truth table, should persuade you that there is no such operation in logic.
It may seem reasonable to argue that since there is no such operation in logic, <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\texttt{NOT}}\)</span> is impossible.
But it does exist!
Experimental physicists routinely construct such ``impossible’’ gates in their laboratories.
It is a physically admissible operation described by the unitary matrix<label for="tufte-sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">25</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-25" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">25</span> There are infinitely many unitary operations that act as the square root of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{NOT}\)</span>.</span>

<p>The identity is just a quantum wire, and we have already seen the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> gates in <a href="qubits.html#phase-gates-galore">Phase gates galore</a>, as the bit-flip and phase-flip (respectively).
Note that, of these latter two, only the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> gate has a classical analogue (as the logical <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{NOT}\)</span> operator).
The remaining gate, the <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> operator, describes the combined effect of both the bit- and the phase-flip: <span class="math inline">\(ZX=iY\)</span>.</p>
<p>In fact, this is just one of the equations that the Pauli matrices satisfy.
The Pauli matrices are both unitary and Hermitian, they square to the identity, and they anti-commute.
By this last point, we mean that

As already mentioned, they satisfy <span class="math inline">\(ZX=iY\)</span>, but also any cyclic permutation of this equation.</p>
<p>These operators are also called <strong>sigma matrices</strong>, or <strong>Pauli spin matrices</strong>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.9</span> Any unitary operation on a single qubit</h2>
<p>There are infinitely many unitary operations that can be performed on a single qubit.
In general, any complex <span class="math inline">\((n\times n)\)</span> matrix has <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> complex entries, and can thus be specified by <span class="math inline">\(2n^2\)</span> real independent parameters.
The unitarity constraint removes <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> of these, and so any unitary <span class="math inline">\((n\times n)\)</span> matrix has <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> real independent parameters.
In particular, we need <em>four</em> real parameters to specify a <span class="math inline">\((2\times 2)\)</span> unitary matrix.
If we are prepared to ignore global phase factors (which we are) then there are only three real parameters left.
So, with this in mind, can we construct and implement any unitary on a single qubit in some simple way?</p>
<p><em>Yes, we can.</em></p>
<p>Any unitary operation on a qubit (up to an overall multiplicative phase factor) can be implemented by a circuit containing just two Hadamards and three phase gates, with adjustable phase settings, as in Figure <a href="qubits.html#fig:universal-circuit-for-2-by-2">2.2</a>.</p>

In order to see that this construction does what it claims, let us explore an intriguing mathematical connection between single qubit unitaries and rotations in three dimensions.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-bloch-sphere" class="section level2" number="2.10">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.10</span> The Bloch sphere</h2>
<p>Unitary operations on a single qubit form a group.
More precisely, the set of all <span class="math inline">\((2\times 2)\)</span> unitary matrices forms a non-abelian group under the matrix multiplication, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{U}(2)\)</span>.
It turns out that compositions of single qubit unitaries behave pretty much the same as compositions of rotations in three dimensions.
Technically speaking, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{U}(2)/\mathrm{U}(1)\cong \mathrm{SO}(3)\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">32</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-32" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">32</span> Note that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{U}(1)\cong\mathbb{C}^\times\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^\times\)</span> is the multiplicative group of unit elements of the complex numbers, i.e. the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\)</span> with the group operation given by multiplication.</span>
That is, <span class="math inline">\((2\times 2)\)</span> unitaries, up to global phase, form a group which is isomorphic to the group of rotations in three dimensions, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SO}(3)\)</span>.
This isomorphism helps to visualise the actions of single qubit gates.</p>
<p>There are many ways to introduce this isomorphism.
Here we will first show how to represent single-qubit state vectors in terms of Euclidean vectors in three dimensions, and then relate unitary operations on state vectors to rotations in this Euclidean space.</p>
<p>Any single qubit state can be written as <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle=\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle\)</span>, constrained by the relation <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1\)</span>.
This suggests a more natural parametrisation as<label for="tufte-sn-33" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">33</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-33" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">33</span> There is a good reason to use <span class="math inline">\(\theta/2\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, which we will explain later on.</span>
<span class="math display">\[
  |\psi\rangle =
  \cos\frac{\theta}{2}e^{i\varphi_0}|0\rangle
  + \sin\frac{\theta}{2}e^{i\varphi_1}|1\rangle.
\]</span>
We can then factor out a global phase:
<span class="math display">\[
  |\psi\rangle =
  e^{i\varphi_0}\left(
    \cos\frac{\theta}{2}|0\rangle + \sin\frac{\theta}{2}e^{i\varphi}|1\rangle
  \right),
\]</span>
and even remove it completely, since states that are identical up to a global phase are physically indistinguishable.</p>
<p>The parametrisation in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> should remind you of spherical polar coordinates for the surface of a sphere.</p>

<p>We call this sphere the <strong>Bloch sphere</strong>, and the unit vector <span class="math inline">\({\vec s}\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> the <strong>Bloch vector</strong>.<label for="tufte-sn-34" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">34</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-34" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">34</span> We will revisit this construction again in more detail, and from a slightly different point of view, in <a href="linking-pauli-matrices-and-the-bloch-sphere.html#linking-pauli-matrices-and-the-bloch-sphere">Linking Pauli matrices and the Bloch sphere</a>.</span>
This is a very useful way to visualise quantum states of a single qubit and unitary operations that we perform on it.
Any unitary action on the state vector will induce a rotation of the corresponding Bloch vector.
But what kind of rotation?</p>
<p>Note that any two orthogonal state vectors appear on the Bloch sphere as two Bloch vectors pointing in opposite directions.
Now, the two eigenvectors of a single-qubit unitary <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> must be orthogonal, and thus define an axis running through the centre of the Bloch sphere.
This is the axis about which the Bloch vector is rotated when <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> acts on the corresponding state vector.
The rotation angle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is given by the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, which, up to a global phase factor, are of the form <span class="math inline">\(e^{\mp i\alpha/2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is instructive to work out few simple cases and get a feel for the rotations corresponding to the most common unitaries.
For example, it is easy to check that a phase gate <span class="math inline">\(P_\alpha\)</span> acts by
<span class="math display">\[
  \cos\frac{\theta}{2}|0\rangle + e^{i\varphi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}|1\rangle
  \longmapsto
  \cos\frac{\theta}{2}|0\rangle + e^{i(\varphi+\alpha)}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}|1\rangle.
\]</span>
The azimuthal angle changes from <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\varphi+\alpha\)</span>, and so the Bloch sphere is rotated anticlockwise by <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> about the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis.
The Bloch vectors corresponding to the two eigenvectors of <span class="math inline">\(P_\alpha\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>, define the axis of the rotation.</p>

</div>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Pauli operator <span class="math inline">\(Z=\sigma_z\)</span> is a special case of a phase gate, and represents rotation by <span class="math inline">\({180}^{\circ}\)</span> (that is, <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> radians), about the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis.
You can also verify that <span class="math inline">\(X=\sigma_x\)</span>, with eigenvectors <span class="math inline">\({(|0\rangle\pm|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}}\)</span>, represents rotation by <span class="math inline">\({180}^{\circ}\)</span> about the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, and <span class="math inline">\(Y=\sigma_y\)</span>, with eigenvectors <span class="math inline">\({(|0\rangle\pm i|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}}\)</span>, represents rotation by <span class="math inline">\({180}^{\circ}\)</span> about the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis.</p>
<p>How about the Hadamard gate?
Like the Pauli operators, it squares to the identity (<span class="math inline">\(H^2=\operatorname{id}\)</span>), which implies that its eigenvalues are <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>.
Thus it will correspond to a rotation by <span class="math inline">\({180}^{\circ}\)</span>.
But about which axis?
This time, rather than finding eigenvectors of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, we notice that <span class="math inline">\(HXH=Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(HZH=X\)</span>, thus <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> must swap <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axes, turning rotations about the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis into rotations about the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, and vice versa.
The Hadamard gate must then represent rotation by <span class="math inline">\({180}^{\circ}\)</span> about the diagonal <span class="math inline">\((x+z)\)</span>-axis.
You may also notice that, after this rotation, the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis points in the opposite direction, which seems to be related to another identity: <span class="math inline">\(HYH=-Y\)</span>.
This is not a coincidence.</p>

<p>We are now in a position understand the circuit in Figure <a href="qubits.html#fig:universal-circuit-for-2-by-2">2.2</a> in geometric terms.
Recall that <em>any</em> rotation in the Euclidean space can be performed as a sequence of three rotations: one about the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis, one about the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, and one more about <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis.
The circuit does exactly this:</p>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="480"  style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The first phase gate effects rotation by <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> about the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis, the second phase gate is sandwiched between the two Hadamard gates, and these three gates together effect rotation by <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> about the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, and, finally, the third phase gates effects rotation by <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> about the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis.
So we can implement any unitary <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> by choosing the three phase shifts, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, which are known as the three <strong>Euler’s angles</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to be <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>-close to the desired angle of rotation, then you may need to repeat the rotation by <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> roughly <span class="math inline">\(1/\epsilon\)</span> times.
Indeed, within <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> applications (for <span class="math inline">\(n\alpha\gg 2\pi\)</span>) of <span class="math inline">\(P_\alpha\)</span>, we expect the accessible angles to be approximately evenly distributed within the range <span class="math inline">\([0,2\pi]\)</span>, i.e. any angle of rotation can be achieved to an accuracy of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon=2\pi/n\)</span> by using up to <span class="math inline">\(n\approx 1/\epsilon\)</span> applications of <span class="math inline">\(P_\alpha\)</span>.
So we can use <em>just one</em> phase gate to <em>approximate</em> the <em>three</em> phase gates in the circuit in Figure <a href="qubits.html#fig:universal-circuit-for-2-by-2">2.2</a>.</p>
<p>There are other ways of implementing irrational rotations of the Bloch sphere.
For example, take the Hadamard gate and the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> gate.
You can check that the compositions <span class="math inline">\(THTH\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(HTHT\)</span> represent rotations by angles which are irrational multiples of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, about two different axes.
We can then compose a sequence of these two rotations to approximate any other rotation of the sphere.
This may look very nice in theory, but there are issues with the actual physical implementation of this approach.
All the gates in the circuit will operate with finite precision, and the phase gates will deviate from implementing the required irrational rotations.
It turns out, however, that we can tolerate minor imperfections; the final result will not be that far off.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A symmetric beam-splitter is a cube of glass which reflects half the light that impinges upon it, while allowing the remaining half to pass through unaffected.
For our purposes it can be viewed as a device which has two input and two output ports which we label as <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>, as in Figure <a href="qubits.html#fig:beam-splitter">2.5</a>.</p>

Figure 2.5: A beam-splitter.
</p>
<img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/beam-splitter-1.png" alt="A beam-splitter." width="192"  />
</div>
<p>When we aim a single photon at such a beam-splitter using one of the input ports, we notice that the photon doesn’t split in two: we can place photo-detectors wherever we like in the apparatus, fire in a photon, and verify that if any of the photo-detectors registers a hit, none of the others do.
In particular, if we place a photo-detector behind the beam-splitter in each of the two possible exit beams, the photon is detected with equal probability at either detector, no matter whether the photon was initially fired from input port <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>It may seem obvious that, at the very least, the photon is <em>either</em> in the transmitted beam <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> <em>or</em> in the reflected beam <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> during any one run of this experiment.
Thus we may be tempted to think of the beam-splitter as a random binary switch which, with equal probability, transforms any binary input into one of the two possible outputs.
However, that is not necessarily the case.
Let us introduce a second beam-splitter and place two normal mirrors so that both paths intersect at the second beam-splitter, resulting in something resembling the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (see <a href="qubits.html#fig:two-beam-splitters">2.6</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:two-beam-splitters"></span>

</p>
<img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/two-beam-splitters-1.png" alt="Two beam-splitters with mirrors, so that a photon travels through both." width="480"  />
</div>
<p>Now, the axiom of additivity in probability theory says that whenever something can happen in several alternative ways we add probabilities for each way considered separately.
We might argue that a photon fired into the input port <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> can reach the detector <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> in two <em>mutually exclusive</em> ways: either by two consecutive reflections or by two consecutive transmissions.
Each reflection happens with probability <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> and each transmission happens with probability <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> thus the total probability of reaching detector 0 is a sum of the probability of the two consecutive reflections (<span class="math inline">\(1/2\times 1/2 = 1/4\)</span>) and the probability of the two consecutive transmissions (<span class="math inline">\(1/2\times 1/2 = 1/4\)</span>) which gives probability <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>.
This is summarised in <a href="qubits.html#fig:classical-guess-double-beam-splitter">2.7</a>, and makes perfect sense — a random switch followed by a random switch should give nothing else but a random switch.
However, if we set up such an experiment, that is not what happens!</p>
<div class="idea">
<p>There is no reason why probability theory or any other a priori mathematical construct should make any meaningful statements about outcomes of physical experiments.</p>

</div>
<p>In experimental reality, when the optical paths between the two beam-splitters are the same, the photon fired from input port <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> <em>always</em> strikes detector 1 and <em>never</em> detector 0 (and the photon fired from input port <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> <em>always</em> strikes detector 0 and <em>never</em> detector 1).
Thus a beam-splitter acts as the square root of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{NOT}\)</span> gate.</p>
<p>The action of the beam-splitter — in fact, the action of any quantum device — can be described by tabulating the amplitudes of transitions between its input and output ports.<label for="tufte-sn-37" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">37</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-37" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">37</span> Note that gate <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is not the same square root of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{NOT}\)</span> as the one described in the first diagram in this section. There are infinitely many ways of implementing this “impossible” logical operation.</span>
<span class="math display" id="eq:beam-splitter">\[\begin{equation}

  \frac{i}{\sqrt 2} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}
  \end{bmatrix}.
\tag{2.2}
\end{equation}\]</span>
The matrix element <span class="math inline">\(B_{lk}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k,l=0,1\)</span>, represents the amplitude of transition from input <span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle\)</span> to output <span class="math inline">\(|l\rangle\)</span> (watch the order of indices).
Each reflection (entries <span class="math inline">\(B_{01}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_{10}\)</span>) happens with amplitude <span class="math inline">\(i/\sqrt{2}\)</span> and each transmission (entries <span class="math inline">\(B_{00}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_{11}\)</span>) happens with amplitude <span class="math inline">\(1/\sqrt{2}\)</span>.
Thus the total amplitude that a photon fired from input port <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> will reach detector <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is the sum of the amplitude of the two consecutive reflections (<span class="math inline">\(i/\sqrt{2}\times i/{\sqrt 2} = -1/2\)</span>) and the amplitude of the two consecutive transmissions (<span class="math inline">\(1/{\sqrt 2}\times 1/{\sqrt 2} = 1/2\)</span>) which gives the total amplitude <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.
The resulting probability is then zero.
Unlike probabilities, amplitudes can cancel out each other out.
We can now go on and calculate the amplitude that the photon will reach detector <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.
In this case we will get <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, which gives probability <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.
We can then switch to input <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> and repeat our calculations.

<p>However, instead of going through all the paths in this diagram and linking specific inputs to specific outputs, we can simply multiply the transition matrices:

<p>It consists of two beam-splitters (the square boxes, bottom left and top right) and two slivers of glass of different thickness which are inserted into each of the optical paths connecting the two beam-splitters.
The slivers are usually referred to as “phase shifters” and their thicknesses, <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1\)</span>, are measured in units of the photon’s wavelength multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>.

<p>A photon (the coloured dot in the figure) impinges on the first beam-splitter from one of the two input ports (here input 1) and begins its journey towards one of the two photodetectors.
Let<label for="tufte-sn-39" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">39</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-39" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">39</span> We will often use <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as an index even though it is also used for the imaginary unit. Hopefully, no confusion will arise for it should be clear from the context which one is which.</span> <span class="math inline">\(U_{ij}\)</span> denote the probability amplitude that the photon initially in input port <span class="math inline">\(j=0,1\)</span> ends up in detector <span class="math inline">\(i=0,1\)</span>.
At each of the two beam-splitters the photon is transmitted with the probability amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{T}\)</span> and reflected with the probability amplitude <span class="math inline">\(i\sqrt{R}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(R+T=1\)</span>, and the two phase shifters modify the amplitudes by phase factors <span class="math inline">\(e^{i\varphi_0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e^{i\varphi_1}\)</span>, respectively.
In quantum theory we almost always start with the amplitudes, and once we have a full expression for the amplitude of a given outcome we square its absolute value to get the corresponding probability.
For example, let us calculate <span class="math inline">\(U_{00}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We notice that there are two alternative ways for the photon in the input port <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to end up in the output port <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.
It can take the lower path, through the phase shifter <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_0\)</span>, or the upper path, through the phase shifter <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1\)</span>.
The lower path implies two consecutive transmissions at the beam-splitters and the phase factor <span class="math inline">\(e^{i\varphi_0}\)</span>, whereas the upper path implies two consecutive reflections and the phase factor <span class="math inline">\(e^{i\varphi_1}\)</span>.
Once the photon ends in the output port <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> there is no way of knowing which path was taken, thus we add the amplitudes pertaining to each path.
The resulting amplitude is
<span class="math display">\[
  U_{00}
  = \sqrt{T} e^{i\varphi_0} \sqrt{T}
  + i\sqrt{R} e^{i\varphi_1} i \sqrt{R},
\]</span>
and the corresponding probability <span class="math inline">\(P_{00}=|U_{00}|^2\)</span> reads
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    P_{00}
    &amp; = \left\vert
          \sqrt{T}e^{i\varphi_0}\sqrt{T} + i\sqrt{R}e^{i\varphi_1}i\sqrt{R}
        \right\vert^2
      = \left\vert
          Te^{i\varphi_0} - Re^{i\varphi_1}

</p>
<p>The “classical” part of this expression, <span class="math inline">\(T^2+R^2\)</span>, basically says that the photon undergoes either two consecutive transmissions with probability <span class="math inline">\(T^2\)</span>, or two consecutive reflections with probability <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>.
The probability of being transmitted through any phase shifter is always <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, hence the phase shifters play no role in the classical description of this process.
But the classical description is not correct, as the experiments show, whence the interference term <span class="math inline">\(2TR\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_0)\)</span> in which the phase shifters play the essential role.
Depending on the <em>relative</em> phase <span class="math inline">\(\varphi=\varphi_1-\varphi_0\)</span> the probability that the detector <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> “clicks” can vary from <span class="math inline">\((T-R)^2\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(\varphi=0\)</span>, to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(\varphi=\pi\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we do not care about the experimental details, we can represent the action of the Mach–Zehnder interferometer in terms of a diagram: see <a href="qubits.html#fig:mach-zehnder-diagram">2.10</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Here we can follow, from left to right, the multiple different paths that a photon can take in between specific input and output ports.
The amplitude along any given path is just the product of the amplitudes pertaining to the path segments (Rule 1), while the overall amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes for the many different paths (Rule 2). You can, for example, see that the probability amplitude <span class="math inline">\(U_{10}\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[
  U_{10}
  = \sqrt{T}e^{i\varphi_0}i\sqrt{R} + i\sqrt{R}e^{i\varphi_1}\sqrt{T}
\]</span>
and the corresponding probability is
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    P_{10}
    &amp; = \left\vert
        \sqrt{T}e^{i\varphi_0}i\sqrt{R} + i\sqrt{R}e^{i\varphi_1}\sqrt{T}
      \right\vert^2
  \\&amp; = 2RT + 2RT\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_0).
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
Again, the first term is of “classical” origin and represents probabilities corresponding to each path: one reflection followed by one transmission plus one transmission followed by one reflection, that is, <span class="math inline">\(RT+TR=2RT\)</span>.
The second term is the interference term.
Clearly, the photon entering port <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> will end up in one of the two detectors, hence,
<span class="math display">\[
  P_{00} + P_{10}
  = R^2 + 2RT + T^2
  = (T+R)^2
  = 1.
\]</span>
