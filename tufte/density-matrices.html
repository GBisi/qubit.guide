<p>On … <strong>!!!TODO!!!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We cannot always assign a definite state vector to a quantum system.
It may be that the system is part of a composite system that is in an entangled state, or it may be that our knowledge of the preparation of a particular system is insufficient to determine its state (for example, someone may prepare a particle in one of the states <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_1\rangle, |\psi_2\rangle, \ldots, |\psi_n\rangle\)</span>, with (respective) probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\)</span>).
Nevertheless, in either case we are able to make statistical predictions about the outcomes of measurements performed on the system using a more general description of quantum states.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned that the existence of entangled states begs an obvious question: if we cannot attribute a state vectors to an individual quantum system then how shall we describe its quantum state?
In this lecture we will introduce an alternate description of quantum states that can be applied both to a composite system and to any of its subsystems.
Our new mathematical tool is called a <strong>density operator</strong>.<label for="tufte-sn-45" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">45</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-45" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">45</span> If we choose a particular basis, operators become matrices. Here I will use both terms (density <em>operators</em> and density <em>matrices</em>) interchangeably.</span>
We will start with the density operator as a description of the mixture of quantum states, and will then discuss the partial trace, which is a unique operation that takes care of the reduction of a density operator of a composite system to density operators of its components.</p>
<div id="definitions" class="section level2" number="9.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Definitions</h2>
<p>If you are an impatient mathematically minded person, who feels more comfortable when things are properly defined right from the beginning, here is your definition:<label for="tufte-sn-46" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">46</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-46" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">46</span> A self-adjoint matrix <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is said to be <strong>non-negative</strong>, or <strong>positive semi-definite</strong>, if <span class="math inline">\(\langle v|M|v\rangle\geq 0\)</span> for any vector <span class="math inline">\(|v\rangle\)</span>, or if all of its eigenvalues are non-negative, or if here exists a matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(M=A^\dagger A\)</span>. (This is called a <strong>Cholesky factorization</strong>.)</span></p>
<div class="idea">
<p>A <strong>density operator</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> on a finite dimensional Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span> is any non-negative self-adjoint operator with trace equal to one.</p>
</div>
<p>It follows that any such <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> can always be diagonalised, that the eigenvalues are all real and non-negative, and that the eigenvalues sum to one.
Moreover, given two density operators <span class="math inline">\(\rho_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_2\)</span>, we can always construct another density operator as a convex sum of the two:
<span class="math display">\[
  \rho = p_1\rho_1 + p_2\rho_2
  \qquad\text{where}\quad
  p_1, p_2 \geq 0
  \text{ and }
  p_1+p_2 = 1.
\]</span>
You should check that <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> has all the defining properties of a density matrix, i.e. that it is self-adjoint, non-negative, and that its trace is one.
This means that density operators form a convex set.<label for="tufte-sn-47" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">47</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-47" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">47</span> A subset of a vector space is said to be <strong>convex</strong> if, for any two points in the subset, the straight line segment joining them is also entirely contained inside the subset.</span>
An important example of a density operator is a rank one projector.<label for="tufte-sn-48" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">48</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-48" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">48</span> The <strong>rank</strong> of a matrix is the number of its non-zero eigenvalues.</span>
Any quantum state that can be described by the state vector <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span>, called a <strong>pure state</strong>, can be also described by the density operator <span class="math inline">\(\rho=|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\)</span>.
Pure states are the extremal points in the convex set of density operators: they cannot be expressed as a convex sum of other elements in the set.
In contrast, all other states, called <strong>mixed states</strong>, can be always written as the convex sum of pure states: <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(p_i\geq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i p_i=1\)</span>).
Now that we have cleared the mathematical essentials, we will turn to physical applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="mixtures" class="section level2" number="9.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Mixtures</h2>
<p>Let us start with probability distributions over state vectors.
Suppose Alice prepares a quantum system and hands it over to Bob who subsequently measures observable <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.
If Alice’s preparation is described by a state vector <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span>, then, quantum theory declares, the average value of any observable <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(\langle\psi|M|\psi\rangle\)</span>, which can be also written as<label for="tufte-sn-49" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">49</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-49" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">49</span> If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is one of the orthogonal projectors <span class="math inline">\(P_k\)</span> describing the measurement, then the average <span class="math inline">\(\langle P_k\rangle\)</span> is the probability of the outcome <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> associated with this projector.</span>
<span class="math display">\[
  \langle M\rangle = \operatorname{tr}M|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|.
\]</span>
This way of expressing the average value makes a clear separation between the contributions from the state preparation and from the choice of the measurement.
We have two operators under the trace: one of them, <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\)</span>, describes the state preparation, and the other one, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, the measurement.
Now, suppose Alice prepares the quantum system in one of the states <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_1\rangle,\ldots,|\psi_m\rangle\)</span>, choosing state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_i\rangle\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span>, and hands the system to Bob without telling him which state was chosen.
The possible states <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_i\rangle\)</span> are normalised but need not be orthogonal.
We call this situation a <strong>mixture of the states</strong> <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_i\rangle\)</span>, or a <strong>mixed state</strong> for short.</p>
<div class="idea">
<p>Remember, a mixture of states is very different from a superposition of states: a superposition <em>always</em> yields a definite state vector, whereas a mixture does <em>not</em>, and so must be described by a density operator.</p>
</div>
<p>Bob knows the ensemble of states <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_1\rangle,\ldots,|\psi_m\rangle\)</span> and the corresponding probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(p_1,\ldots,p_m\)</span>, and can hence calculate <span class="math inline">\(\langle M\rangle\)</span> as<label for="tufte-sn-50" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">50</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-50" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">50</span> A pure state can be seen as a special case of a mixed state, where all but one the probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> equal zero.</span>
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \langle M\rangle
    &amp;= \sum_i p_i\left( \operatorname{tr}M|\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i| \right)
  \\&amp;= \operatorname{tr}M \underbrace{\left( \sum_i p_i|\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i| \right)}_{\rho}
  \\&amp;=\operatorname{tr}M\rho.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
Again, we have two operators under the trace: <span class="math inline">\(\rho=\sum_i p_i|\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|\)</span>, which pertains to the state preparation, and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, which describes the measurement.
We shall call the operator
<span class="math display">\[
  \rho = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|
\]</span>
the <strong>density operator</strong>, since it has all the defining properties of the density operator (the convex sum of rank one projectors).
It depends on the constituent states <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_i\rangle\)</span> and their probabilities, and it describes our ignorance about the state preparation.
Once we have <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> we can make statistical predictions: for any observable <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> we have
<span class="math display">\[
  \langle M\rangle = \operatorname{tr}M\rho.
\]</span>
We see that the exact composition of the mixture does not enter this formula: for computing the statistics associated with any observable property of a system, all that matters is the density operator itself, and not its decomposition into the mixture of states.
This is important because any given density operator, with the remarkable exception of a pure state, can arise from many different mixtures of pure states.
Consider, for example, the following three scenarios:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Alice flips a fair coin.
If the result is <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{Heads}\)</span> then she prepares the qubit in the state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span>, and if the result is <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{Tails}\)</span> then she prepares the qubit in the state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>.
She gives Bob the qubit without revealing the result of the coin-flip.
Bob’s knowledge of the qubit is described by the density matrix
<span class="math display">\[
   \frac12|0\rangle\langle 0| + \frac12|1\rangle\langle 1|
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac12 &amp; 0
   \\0 &amp; \frac12
   \end{bmatrix}.
 \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Suppose Alice flips a fair coin, as before, but now if the result is <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{Heads}\)</span> then she prepares the qubit in the state <span class="math inline">\(|\bar{0}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)\)</span>, and if the result is <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{Tails}\)</span> then she prepares the qubit in the state <span class="math inline">\(|\bar{1}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)\)</span>.
Bob’s knowledge of the qubit is now described by the density matrix
<span class="math display">\[
   \begin{aligned}
     \frac12|\bar{0}\rangle\langle\bar{0}| + \frac12|\bar{1}\rangle\langle\bar{1}|
     &amp;=
     \frac12
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac12 &amp; \frac12
     \\\frac12 &amp; \frac12
     \end{bmatrix}
     +
     \frac12
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac12 &amp; -\frac12
     \\-\frac12 &amp; \frac12
     \end{bmatrix}
   \\&amp;=
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac12 &amp; 0
     \\0 &amp; \frac12
     \end{bmatrix}.
   \end{aligned}
 \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Suppose Alice picks up any pair of orthogonal states of a qubit and then flips the coin to chose one of them.
Any two orthonormal states of a qubit, <span class="math inline">\(|u_1\rangle\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|u_2\rangle\)</span>, form a complete basis, so the mixture <span class="math inline">\(\frac12|u_1\rangle\langle u_1|+\frac12|u_2\rangle\langle u_2|\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(\frac12\operatorname{id}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, these three different preparations yield precisely the same density matrix and are hence statistically indistinguishable.
In general, two different mixtures can be distinguished (in a statistical sense) if and only if they yield different density matrices.
In fact, the optimal way of distinguishing quantum states with different density operators is still an active area of research.</p>

<div id="a-few-instructive-examples-and-some-less-instructive-remarks" class="section level2" number="9.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> A few instructive examples, and some less instructive remarks</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The density matrix corresponding to the state vector <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> is the rank one projector <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\)</span>.
Observe that there is no phase ambiguity, since <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\mapsto e^{i\phi}|\psi\rangle\)</span> leaves the density matrix unchanged, and each <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> gives rise to a distinct density matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>If Alice prepares a qubit in the state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle\)</span> then the corresponding density matrix is the projector
<span class="math display">\[
   |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     |\alpha|^2 &amp; \alpha\beta^\star
   \\\alpha^\star\beta &amp; |\beta|^2
   \end{bmatrix}.
 \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>You are given a qubit and you are told that it was prepared either in state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha|^2\)</span> or in state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(|\beta|^2\)</span>.
In this case all you can say is that your qubit is in a mixed state described by the density matrix
<span class="math display">\[
   |\alpha|^2|0\rangle\langle 0| + |\beta|^2|1\rangle\langle 1|
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     |\alpha|^2 &amp; 0
   \\0 &amp; |\beta|^2
   \end{bmatrix}.
 \]</span>
Diagonal density matrices correspond to classical probability distributions on the set of basis vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you want to distinguish between preparations described by the density matrices in examples 2 and 3.
Assume that you are given sufficiently many identically prepared qubits described either by the density matrix in example 2 or by the density matrix in example 3.
Which of the two measurements would you choose: the measurement in the standard basis <span class="math inline">\(\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}\)</span>, or the measurement in the basis <span class="math inline">\(\{|\psi\rangle,|\psi_\perp\rangle\}\)</span>?
One of the two measurements is completely useless.
Which one, and why?</p></li>
<li><p>In general, the diagonal entries of a density matrix describe the probability distributions on the set of basis vectors.
They must add up to one, which is why the trace of any density matrix is one.
The off-diagonal elements, often called <strong>coherences</strong>, signal departure from the classical probability distribution and quantify the degree to which a quantum system can interfere (we will discuss this in detail later on).
The process in which off-diagonal entries (the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> in the matrices below) go to zero is called <strong>decoherence</strong>.
<span class="math display">\[
   \begin{bmatrix}
     |\alpha|^2 &amp; \alpha\beta^\star
   \\\alpha^\star\beta &amp; |\beta|^2
   \end{bmatrix}
   \mapsto
   \begin{bmatrix}
     |\alpha|^2 &amp; \epsilon
   \\\epsilon^\star &amp; |\beta|^2
   \end{bmatrix}
   \mapsto
   \begin{bmatrix}
     |\alpha|^2 &amp; 0
   \\0 &amp; |\beta|^2
   \end{bmatrix}
 \]</span>
For <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = \alpha\beta^\star\)</span> we have a pure quantum state (“full interference capability”) and for <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon=0\)</span> we have a classical probability distribution over the standard basis (“no interference capability”).</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose it is equally likely that your qubit was prepared either in state <span class="math inline">\(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle\)</span> or in state <span class="math inline">\(\alpha|0\rangle - \beta|1\rangle\)</span>.
This means that your qubit is in a mixed state described by the density matrix
<span class="math display">\[
   \frac12
   \begin{bmatrix}
     |\alpha|^2 &amp; \alpha\beta^\star
   \\\alpha^\star\beta &amp; |\beta|^2
   \end{bmatrix}
   +
   \frac12
   \begin{bmatrix}
     |\alpha|^2 &amp; -\alpha\beta^\star
   \\-\alpha^\star\beta &amp; |\beta|^2
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     |\alpha|^2 &amp; 0
   \\0 &amp; |\beta|^2
   \end{bmatrix}.
 \]</span>
You cannot tell the difference between the equally weighted mixture of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha|0\rangle\pm\beta|1\rangle\)</span> and a mixture of <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> with (respective) probabilities <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha|^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\beta|^2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For any density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, the most natural mixture that yields <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is its spectral decomposition: <span class="math inline">\(\rho=\sum_i p_i|u_i\rangle\langle u_i|\)</span>, with eigenvectors <span class="math inline">\(|u_i\rangle\)</span> and eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If the states <span class="math inline">\(|u_1\rangle,\ldots,|u_m\rangle\)</span> form an orthonormal basis, and each occurs with equal probability <span class="math inline">\(1/m\)</span>, then the resulting density matrix is proportional to the identity:
<span class="math display">\[
   \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|
   = \frac{1}{m}\operatorname{id}.
 \]</span>
This is called the <strong>maximally mixed state</strong>.
For qubits, any pair of orthogonal states taken with equal probabilities gives the maximally mixed state <span class="math inline">\(\frac12\operatorname{id}\)</span>.
In maximally mixed states, outcomes of <em>any</em> measurement are completely random.</p></li>
<li><p>It is often convenient to write density operators in terms of projectors on states which are not normalised, incorporating the probabilities into the length of the state vector:
<span class="math display">\[
   \rho = \sum_i|\widetilde\psi_i\rangle\langle\widetilde\psi_i|
 \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(|\widetilde\psi_i\rangle = \sqrt{p_i}|\psi_i\rangle\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(p_i=\langle\widetilde\psi_i\rangle{\widetilde\psi_i}\)</span>.
This form is more compact, but you have to remember that the state vectors are <em>not</em> normalised.
I tend to mark such states with the tilde, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(|\widetilde\psi\rangle\)</span>, but you may have your own way to remember.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Mixed states of a qubit, and the Bloch sphere</h2>
<p><strong>!!!TODO!!! mention the part in chapters 2 and 3 where we have already talked about this, and maybe rewrite the following with that in mind</strong></p>
<p>There is an elegant way to visualise the set of density operators for a qubit.
The most general Hermitian <span class="math inline">\((2\times 2)\)</span> matrix has four real parameters and can be expanded in the basis composed of the identity and the three Pauli matrices: <span class="math inline">\(\{\operatorname{id}, \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\}\)</span>.
Since the Pauli matrices are traceless, the coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{id}\)</span> in the expansion of a density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> must be <span class="math inline">\(\frac12\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tr}\rho=1\)</span>.
Thus <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> may be expressed as<label for="tufte-sn-51" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">51</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-51" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">51</span> Physicists usually refer to the Bloch ball as the <strong>Bloch sphere</strong>, although it really is a ball, not a sphere.</span>
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \rho
    &amp;= \frac12\left( \operatorname{id}+\vec{s}\cdot\vec{\sigma} \right)
  \\&amp;= \frac12\left( \operatorname{id}+ s_x\sigma_x + s_y\sigma_y + s_z\sigma_z \right)
  \\&amp;= \frac12
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 + s_z &amp; s_x - is_y
    \\s_x + is_y &amp; 1 - s_z
    \end{bmatrix}.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
The vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{s}\)</span> is called the <strong>Bloch vector</strong> for the density operator <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>.
Any real Bloch vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{s}\)</span> defines a trace one Hermitian operator <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, but in order for <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> to be a density operator it must also be non-negative.
Which Bloch vectors yield legitimate density operators?</p>
<p>Let us compute the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>.
The sum of the two eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is, of course, equal to one (<span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tr}\rho=1\)</span>) and the product is equal to the determinant of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, which can be computed from the matrix form above:
<span class="math display">\[
  \det\rho
  = \frac{1}{4}(1-s^2)
  = \frac12(1+s)\frac12(1+s)
\]</span>

It follows that the two eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(\frac12(1\pm s)\)</span>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> Subsystems of entangled systems</h2>
<p>I have already trumpeted that one of the most important features of the density operator formalism is its ability to describe the quantum state of a subsystem of a composite system.
Let me now show you how it works.</p>
<p>Given a quantum state of the composite system <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{AB}\)</span>, described by some density operator <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{AB}\)</span>, we obtain reduced density operators <span class="math inline">\(\rho^A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho^B\)</span> of subsystems <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span>, respectively, by the partial trace:
<strong>!!!TODO!!! should this be <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{\mathcal{A}\mathcal{B}}\)</span>? and <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tr}_{\mathcal{A}}\)</span>? etc., or should <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> actually be <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_A\)</span>?</strong>
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \rho^{AB}
    &amp;\mapsto
    \underbrace{\rho_A=\operatorname{tr}_B\rho^{AB}}_{\mathrm{partial\,trace\,over}\,\mathcal{B}}\qquad
  \\\rho^{AB}
    &amp;\mapsto
    \underbrace{\rho_B=\operatorname{tr}_A\rho^{AB}}_{\mathrm{partial\,trace\,over}\,\mathcal{A}}
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
We define the partial trace over <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>, first on a tensor product of two operators <span class="math inline">\(A\otimes B\)</span> as
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \operatorname{tr}_B (A\otimes B)
    &amp;= A(\operatorname{tr}B)
  \\\operatorname{tr}_A (A\otimes B)
    &amp;= (\operatorname{tr}A) B,
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
and then extend to any operator on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_A\otimes\mathcal{H}_B\)</span> by linearity.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example.
Suppose a composite system <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{AB}\)</span> is in a pure entangled state, which we can always write as
<span class="math display">\[
  |\psi_{AB}\rangle
  = \sum_{i} c_{i} |a_i\rangle\otimes|b_i\rangle,
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(|a_i\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|b_j\rangle\)</span> are two orthonormal bases (e.g. the Schmidt bases), and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i |c_i|^2 = 1\)</span> due to the normalisation.
The corresponding density operator of the composite system is the projector <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{AB}= |\psi_{AB}\rangle\langle\psi_{AB}|\)</span>, which we can write as
<span class="math display">\[
  \rho^{AB}
  = |\psi_{AB}\rangle\langle\psi_{AB}|
  = \sum_{ij} c_i c^\star_j |a_i\rangle\langle a_j| \otimes |b_i\rangle\langle b_j|
\]</span>
Let us compute the reduced density operator <span class="math inline">\(\rho^A\)</span> by taking the partial trace over <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \rho_A
    &amp;= \operatorname{tr}_B\rho^{AB}
  \\&amp;= \operatorname{tr}_B |\psi_{AB}\rangle\langle\psi_{AB}|
  \\&amp;= \operatorname{tr}_B \sum_{ij} c_i c^\star_j |a_i\rangle\langle a_j| \otimes |b_i\rangle\langle b_j|
  \\&amp;= \sum_{ij} c_i c^\star_j |a_i\rangle\langle a_j|(\operatorname{tr}|b_i\rangle\langle b_j|)
  \\&amp;= \sum_{ij} c_i c^\star_j |a_i\rangle\langle a_j| \underbrace{\langle b_i\rangle{b_j}}_{\delta_{ij}}
  \\&amp; = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 |a_i\rangle\langle a_i|
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
where we have used the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tr}|b_i\rangle\langle b_j| = \langle b_j|b_i\rangle=\delta_{ij}\)</span>.
In the <span class="math inline">\(|a_i\rangle\)</span> basis, the reduced density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho^A\)</span> is diagonal, with entries <span class="math inline">\(p_i=|c_i|^2\)</span>.
We can also take the partial trace over <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> and obtain <span class="math inline">\(\rho_B = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 |b_i\rangle\langle b_i|\)</span>.
In particular, for the maximally entangled states in the <span class="math inline">\((d\times d)\)</span>-dimensional Hilbert spaces <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_A\otimes\mathcal{H}_B\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[
  |\psi_{AB}\rangle
  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \sum_{i}^d |a_i\rangle|b_i\rangle,
\]</span>
and the reduced density operators, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_B\)</span>, are the maximally mixed states: <span class="math inline">\(\rho_A=\rho_B=\frac{1}{d}\operatorname{id}\)</span>.
It follows that the quantum states of individual qubits in any of the Bell states are maximally mixed: their density matrix is <span class="math inline">\(\frac12\operatorname{id}\)</span>.
A state such as
<span class="math display">\[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \left( |00\rangle + |11\rangle \right)
\]</span>
guarantees perfect correlations when each qubit is measured in the standard basis: the two equally likely outcomes are (<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>) or (<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>), but any single qubit outcome, be it <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or anything else, is completely random.</p>

<div id="partial-trace-revisited" class="section level2" number="9.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.6</span> Partial trace, revisited</h2>
<p>If you are given a matrix you calculate the trace by summing its diagonal entries.
How about the partial trace?
Suppose someone writes down for you a density matrix of two qubits in the standard basis, <span class="math inline">\(\{|00\rangle, |01\rangle, |10\rangle, |11\rangle\}\)</span>, and asks you to find the reduced density matrices of the individual qubits.
The tensor product structure of this <span class="math inline">\((4\times 4)\)</span> matrix means that it is has a block form:
<span class="math display">\[
  \rho^{AB}
  =
  \left[
    \begin{array}{c|c}
      P &amp; Q
    \\\hline
      R &amp; S
    \end{array}
  \right]
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(P,Q,R,S\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> sized sub-matrices.
The two partial traces can then be evaluated as<label for="tufte-sn-53" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">53</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-53" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">53</span> Take any of the Bell states, write its <span class="math inline">\((4\times 4)\)</span>-density matrix explicitly, and then trace over each qubit.

<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \rho_A
    &amp;=
    \operatorname{tr}_{B}\rho^{AB}

  \\\rho_B
    &amp;= \operatorname{tr}_{A}\rho^{AB}
    = P+S.

The same holds for a general <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{AB}\)</span> on any <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_A\otimes\mathcal{H}_B\)</span> with corresponding block form (<span class="math inline">\((m\times m)\)</span> blocks of <span class="math inline">\((n\times n)\)</span>-sized sub-matrices, where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> are the dimensions of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_B\)</span>, respectively).</p>
</div>
<div id="mixtures-and-subsystems" class="section level2" number="9.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.7</span> Mixtures and subsystems</h2>
<p>We have used the density operators to describe two distinct situations: the statistical properties of the mixtures of states, and the statistical properties of subsystems of composite systems.
In order to see the relationship between the two, consider a joint state of a bipartite system <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{AB}\)</span>, written in a product basis in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_A\otimes\mathcal{H}_B\)</span> as
<span class="math display" id="eq:bipartite">\[\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    |\psi_{AB}\rangle
    &amp;= \sum_{ij} c_{ij}|a_i\rangle\otimes|b_j\rangle
  \\&amp;= \sum_{j=1} |\widetilde\psi_j\rangle|b_j\rangle
  \\&amp;= \sum_{j=1} \sqrt{p_j}|\psi_j\rangle|b_j\rangle
  \end{aligned}
\tag{9.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(|\widetilde\psi_j\rangle = \sum_i c_{ij}|a_i\rangle = \sqrt{p_j}|\psi_j\rangle\)</span>, and the vectors <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_j\rangle\)</span> are the normalised versions of the <span class="math inline">\(|\widetilde\psi_j\rangle\)</span>.
Note that <span class="math inline">\(p_j=\langle\widetilde\psi_j|\widetilde\psi_j\rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then the partial trace over <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> gives the reduced density operator of subsystem <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \rho^A
    =\operatorname{tr}_B \sum_{ij} |\widetilde\psi_i\rangle\langle\widetilde\psi_j| \otimes |b_i\rangle\langle b_j|
    &amp;= \sum_{ij} |\widetilde\psi_i\rangle\langle\widetilde\psi_j| (\operatorname{tr}|b_i\rangle\langle b_j|)
  \\&amp;= \sum_{ij} |\widetilde\psi_i\rangle\langle\widetilde\psi_j| \langle b_j|b_i\rangle
  \\&amp;= \sum_{i} |\widetilde\psi_i\rangle\langle\widetilde\psi_i|
    = \sum_{i} p_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now, let us see how <span class="math inline">\(\rho^A\)</span> can be understood in terms of mixtures.
Let us place subsystems <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> in separate labs, run by Alice and Bob, respectively.
When Bob measures part <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(|b_j\rangle\)</span> basis and obtains result <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, which happens with the probability <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span>, he prepares subsystem <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> in the state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_k\rangle\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
  \sum_{i=1} \sqrt{p_j}|\psi_i\rangle|b_i\rangle
  \overset{\mathrm{outcome}\,k}{\longmapsto}
  |\psi_k\rangle|b_k\rangle.
\]</span>
Bob does not communicate the outcome of his measurement.
Thus, from Alice’s perspective, Bob prepares a mixture of <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_1\rangle,\ldots,|\psi_m\rangle\)</span>, with probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p_1,\ldots,p_m\)</span>, which means that Alice, who knows the joint state but not the outcomes of Bob’s measurement, may associate density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_A=\sum_i p_i|\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|\)</span> with her subsystem <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>.
This is the same <span class="math inline">\(\rho^A\)</span> which we obtained by the partial trace.</p>
<p>But suppose Bob chooses to measure his subsystem in some other basis.
Will it have any impact on Alice’s statistical predictions?
Measurement in the new basis will result in a different mixture, but Alice’s density operator will not change.
Suppose Bob chooses basis <span class="math inline">\(|d_i\rangle\)</span> for his measurement.
Any two orthonormal bases are connected by some unitary transformation, and so we can write <span class="math inline">\(|b_i\rangle = U|d_i\rangle\)</span> for some unitary <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>.
In terms of components, <span class="math inline">\(|b_i\rangle = \sum_j U_{ij}|d_j\rangle\)</span>.
The joint state can now be expressed as
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    |\psi_{AB}\rangle
    &amp;= \sum_{i} |\widetilde\psi_i\rangle|b_i\rangle
  \\&amp;= \sum_{i} |\widetilde\psi_i\rangle \left( \sum_j U_{ij}|d_j\rangle \right)
  \\&amp;= \sum_j \underbrace{\left( \sum_i U_{ij}|\widetilde\psi_i\rangle \right)}_{|\widetilde\phi_j\rangle}|d_j\rangle
  \\&amp;= \sum_j|\widetilde\phi_j\rangle|d_j\rangle.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>If Bob measures in the <span class="math inline">\(|d_i\rangle\)</span> basis then he generates a new mixture of states <span class="math inline">\(|\phi_1\rangle,\ldots|\phi_m\rangle\)</span>, which are the normalised versions of <span class="math inline">\(|\widetilde\phi_1\rangle,\ldots|\widetilde\phi_m\rangle\)</span>, with each <span class="math inline">\(|\phi_k\rangle\)</span> occurring with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_k=\langle\widetilde\phi_k\rangle{\widetilde\phi_k}\)</span>.
But this new mixture has exactly the same density operator as the previous one:<label for="tufte-sn-54" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">54</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-54" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">54</span> The <span class="math inline">\(U_{ij}\)</span> are the components of a unitary matrix, hence <span class="math inline">\(\sum_k U_{ik}U^\star_{jk}=\delta_{ij}\)</span>.</span>
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \sum_j|\widetilde\phi_j\rangle\langle\widetilde\phi_j|
    &amp;= \sum_{ijl} U_{ij}|\widetilde\psi_i\rangle\langle\widetilde\psi_l|U^\star_{lj}
  \\&amp;= \sum_{il} \underbrace{\left(\sum_j U_{ij}U^\star_{lj}\right)}_{\delta_{il}}|\widetilde\psi_i\rangle\langle\widetilde\psi_l|
  \\&amp;= \sum_i|\widetilde\psi_j\rangle\langle\widetilde\psi_j|,
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
which is exactly <span class="math inline">\(\rho_A\)</span>.
So does it really matter whether Bob performs the measurement or not?</p>
<p><em>It does not.</em></p>
<p>After all, Alice and Bob may be miles away from each other, and if any of Bob’s actions were to result in something that is physically detectable at the Alice’s location that would amount to instantaneous communication between the two of them.</p>
<p>From the operational point of view it does not really matter whether the density operator represents our ignorance of the actual state (mixtures) or provides the only description we can have after discarding one part of an entangled state (partial trace).<label for="tufte-sn-55" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">55</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-55" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">55</span> The two interpretations of density operators filled volumes of academic papers. The terms <strong>proper mixtures</strong> and <strong>improper mixtures</strong> are used, mostly by philosophers, to describe the statistical mixture and the partial trace approach, respectively.</span>
In the former case, the system is in some definite pure state but we do not know which.
In contrast, when the density operator arises from tracing out irrelevant, or unavailable, degrees of freedom, the individual system cannot be thought to be in some definite state of which we are ignorant.
Philosophy aside, the fact that the two interpretations give exactly the same predictions is useful: switching back and forth between the two pictures often offers additional insights and may even simplify lengthy calculations.</p>

holds for any observable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> acting on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>.
This condition concerns the consistency of statistical predictions.
Any observable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> can be viewed as an observable <span class="math inline">\(X\otimes\operatorname{id}\)</span> on the composite system <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{AB}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{id}\)</span> is the identity operator acting on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span>.
When constructing <span class="math inline">\(\rho^A\)</span> we had better make sure that for any observable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> the average value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in the state <span class="math inline">\(\rho_A\)</span> is the same as the average value of <span class="math inline">\(X\otimes\operatorname{id}\)</span> in the state <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{AB}\)</span>.
This is indeed the case for the partial trace.</p>
<p>For example, let us go back to the state in <a href="density-matrices.html#eq:bipartite">(9.1)</a> and assume that Alice measures some observable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on her part of the system.

The expected value of this observable in the state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_{AB}\rangle\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tr}(X\otimes\operatorname{id})|\psi_{AB}\rangle\langle\psi_{AB}|\)</span>, i.e.
