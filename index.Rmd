# Introduction {-}

In this series of lectures you will learn how inherently quantum phenomena, such as quantum interference and quantum entanglement, can make information processing more efficient and more secure, even in the presence of noise.

The interdisciplinary nature of this topic, combined with the diverse backgrounds that different readers have, means that some may find some particular chapters easy, while others find them difficult.
The following will be assumed as prerequisites: elementary probability theory, complex numbers, vectors and matrices, tensor products, and Dirac bra-ket notation.
A basic knowledge of quantum mechanics (especially in the simple context of finite dimensional state spaces, e.g. state vectors, composite systems, unitary matrices, Born rule for quantum measurements) and some ideas from classical theoretical computer science (complexity theory) would be helpful, but is not at all essential.
