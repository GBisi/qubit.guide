# Introduction {-}

In this series of lectures you will learn how inherently quantum phenomena, such as quantum interference and quantum entanglement, can make information processing more efficient and more secure, even in the presence of noise.

The interdisciplinary nature of this topic, combined with the diverse backgrounds that different readers have, means that some may find some particular chapters easy, while others find them difficult.
The following will be assumed as prerequisites: elementary probability theory, complex numbers, vectors and matrices, tensor products, and Dirac bra-ket notation.
A basic knowledge of quantum mechanics (especially in the simple context of finite dimensional state spaces, e.g. state vectors, composite systems, unitary matrices, Born rule for quantum measurements) and some ideas from classical theoretical computer science (complexity theory) would be helpful, but is not at all essential.
Some of these things are covered at the end of this chapter.

## Some mathematical preliminaries

### Euclidean vectors

We assume that you are familiar with Euclidean vectors --- those arrow-like geometric objects which are used to represent physical quantities, such as velocities, or forces.
You know that any two velocities can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a "velocity vector" by a real number is another "velocity vector".
So a **linear combination** of vectors is another vector.
Mathematicians have simply taken these properties and defined vectors as _anything_ that we can add and multiply by numbers, as long as everything behaves in a nice enough way.
This is basically what an Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858--1932) did in a chapter of his 1888 book with an impressive title: _Calcolo geometrico secondo l'Ausdehnungslehre di H. Grassmann preceduto dalle operazioni della logica deduttiva_.


### Vector spaces

Following Peano, we define a **vector space** as a mathematical structure in which the notion of linear combination "makes sense".

More formally, a **complex vector space** is a set $V$ such that, given any two **vectors** $a$ and $b$ (that is, any two elements of $V$) and any two complex numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we can form the linear combination^[As we said, there are certain "nice properties" that these things must satisfy. Addition of vectors must be commutative and associative, with an identity (the zero vector, which will always be written as $\mathbf{0}$ ) and an inverse for each $v$ (written as $-v$). Multiplication by complex numbers must obey the two distributive laws: $(\alpha+\beta)v = \alpha v+\beta v$ and $\alpha (v+w) = \alpha v+\alpha w$.] $\alpha a+\beta b$, which is also a vector in $V$.

A **subspace** of $V$ is any subset of $V$ which is closed under vector addition and multiplication by complex numbers.
Here we start using the Dirac bra-ket notation and write vectors in a somewhat fancy way as $\ket{\mbox{label}}$, where the "label" is anything that serves to specify what the vector is.
For example, $\ket{\uparrow}$ and $\ket{\downarrow}$ may refer to an electron with spin up or down along some prescribed direction and $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ may describe a quantum bit (a "qubit") holding either logical $0$ or $1$.
These are often called **ket** vectors, or simply **kets**.
(We will deal with "bras" in a moment).
A **basis** in $V$ is a collection of vectors $\ket{e_1},\ket{e_2},\ldots,\ket{e_n}$ such that every vector $\ket{v}$ in $V$ can be written (in _exactly_ one way) as a linear combination of the basis vectors; $\ket{v}=\sum_i v_i\ket{e_i}$.
The number of elements in a basis is called the **dimension** of $V$.
(Showing that this definition is independent of the basis that we choose is a "fun" linear algebra exercise).
The most common $n$-dimensional complex vector space is the space of ordered $n$-tuples of complex numbers, usually written as column vectors:
$$
  \begin{gathered}
    \ket{a}
    = \begin{bmatrix}a_1\\a_2\\\vdots\\a_n\end{bmatrix}
    \qquad
    \ket{b}
    = \begin{bmatrix}b_1\\b_2\\\vdots\\b_n\end{bmatrix}
  \\\alpha\ket{a}+\beta\ket{b}
    = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha a_1+\beta b_1\\\alpha a_2+\beta b_2\\\vdots\\\alpha a_n+\beta b_n\end{bmatrix}
  \end{gathered}
$$

In fact, this is the space we will use most of the time.
Throughout the course we will deal only with vector spaces of _finite_ dimensions.
This is sufficient for all our purposes and we will avoid many mathematical subtleties associated with infinite dimensional spaces, for which we would need to tools of **functional analysis**.
