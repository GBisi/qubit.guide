# Quantum entanglement {#chapter5}

> On ... **!!!TODO!!!**

We now know everything we need to know about a single qubit and its quantum behaviour.
But if we want to understand quantum computation --- a complicated quantum interference of many interacting qubits --- then we will need few more mathematical tools.
Stepping up from one qubit to two or more is a bigger leap than you might expect.
Already, with just two qubits, we will encounter the remarkable phenomenon of quantum entanglement and have a chance to discuss some of the most puzzling features of quantum theory that took people decades to understand.





## A small history

The notion of **quantum entanglement** was the subject of many early debates that focused on the meaning of quantum theory.
Back in the 1930s, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrodinger (to mention just the usual suspects) were trying hard to understand its conceptual consequences.^[E. Schrodinger, Discussion of probability relations between separated system, _Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society_ **31** (1935), pp. 555--563.]
Einstein, the most sceptical of them all, claimed that it was pointing toward the fatal flaw in quantum theory, and referred to it as "_spooky action-at-a-distance_".
In contrast, SchrÃ¶dinger was much more prepared to accept quantum theory exactly as it was formulated, along with all its predictions, no matter how weird they might be.
In his 1935 paper, which introduced quantum entanglement, he wrote "I would not call it _one_ but rather _the_ characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought".
Today we still talk a lot about quantum entanglement, but more often it is viewed as a physical resource which enables us to communicate with perfect security, build very precise atomic clocks, and even teleport small quantum objects!
But what exactly is quantum entanglement?





## One, two, many...

In classical physics, the transition from a single object to a composite system of many objects is trivial: in order to describe the state of, say, 42 objects at any given moment of time, it is sufficient to describe the state of each of the objects separately.
Indeed, the classical state of 42 point-like particles is described by specifying the position and the momentum of each particle.

That is, in the _classical_ world, "the whole is the sum of its parts".
But the _quantum_ world is quite different.











## Why qubits, subsystems, and entanglement?

One question that is rather natural to ask at this point is the following:

> If entanglement is so fragile and difficult to control, then why bother?
> Why not perform the whole computation in one physical system that has as many quantum states as we normally have labels for the states of qubits, so that we can label these quantum states in the same way as we normally label the qubits, and give _them_ computational meaning?

This suggestion, although possible, gives a very inefficient way of representing data (it is describing the **unary encoding**).
For serious computations _we need subsystems_.
Here is why.

Suppose you have $n$ physical objects, and each object has $k$ distinguishable states.
If you can access each object _separately_ and put it into any of the $k$ states, then, with only $n$ operations, you can prepare any of the $k^{n}$ different configurations of the combined systems.
Without any loss of generality, let us take $k=2$ and refer to each object of this type as a **physical bit**.
We label the two states of a physical bit as $0$ and $1$.
Any collection of $n$ physical bits can be prepared in $2^{n}$ different configurations, which can be used to store up to $2^{n}$ messages/binary strings/different numbers.
In order to represent numbers from $0$ to $N-1$ we just have to choose $n$ such that $N\leq 2^n$.

Suppose the two states in the physical bit are separated by the energy difference $\Delta E$.
Then a preparation of any particular configuration will cost no more than $E=n \Delta E=(\log_2 N)\Delta E$ units of energy.

In contrast, if we choose to encode $N$ configurations into one chunk of matter, say, into the first $N$ energy states of a single harmonic oscillator with the interstate energy separation $\Delta E$ then, in the worst case, one has to use $E=N\Delta E$ units of energy, e.g. to go from the ground state (labelled as $0$) to the most excited state (labelled as $N$).
For large $N$ this gives an exponential gap in the energy expenditure between the binary encoding using physical bits and unary encoding, using energy levels of harmonic oscillators.

One can, of course, try to switch from harmonic oscillators to quantum systems which have a finite spread in the energy spectrum.
For example, by operating on the energy states of the hydrogen atom one can encode any number from $0$ to $N-1$, and one is guaranteed not to spend more than $E_{\mathrm{max}}=$ $13.6\,\mathrm{eV}$ (otherwise the atom is ionised).
The snag is that, in this case, some of the electronic states will be separated by the energy difference to the order of $E_{\mathrm{max}}/N$, and to drive the system selectively from one state to another one has to tune into the frequency $E_{\mathrm{max}}/\hbar N$, which requires a sufficiently long wave-packet (so that the frequency is well defined), and consequently the
interaction time is of order $N(\hbar/E_{\mathrm{max}})$.

That is, we have to trade energy for time.

It turns out that whichever way we try to represent the number $N$ using the unary encoding (i.e. using $N$ different states of a single chunk of matter), we end up depleting our physical resources (such as energy, time, space) at a much greater rate than in the case when we use subsystems.
This plausibility argument indicates that, for efficient processing of information, the system must be divided into subsystems --- for example, into physical bits.
