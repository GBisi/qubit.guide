## Lecture notes

For the past however-many years, [Artur Ekert](https://www.arturekert.com/) has been teaching the masters course "_Introduction to Quantum Information_" at the University of Oxford.
During this time, many versions of accompanying lecture notes have come and gone, with constant improvements and changes being made.
The version that you will find on this website has been carefully edited by [Tim Hosgood](https://thosgood.com) into a cohesive "book", containing additional exercises and topics.

<div style="text-align: center;margin: 2em"><a href="book/" style="padding: 1em;border: 1px solid black;border-radius: 5px;">Read the book</a></div>

<!-- The online book is built using (the [Bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/) fork of) Gitbook.
This means that it has some nice functionality to make reading more comfortable, with most options being accessed through the toolbar at the top (as explained below).

1. Show/hide the table of contents.
2. Search within the entire book.
3. Change display settings (e.g. font size, dark mode).
4. View the source code of the current section on GitHub.
5. Open the PDF version of the book. -->


## Lecture videos

Complementary to the lecture notes, there are also lecture videos covering the same topics (but in a slightly different order), which can be found on YouTube.
These are embedded in the web version of the book, but can also be watched separately as a standalone series.
