## Further reading

The best textbook for this particular course is probably
> P. Kaye, R. Laflamme, and M. Mosca. _An Introduction to Quantum Computing_. Oxford University Press, 2007.

Although it was published in 2000, and thus has a slightly dated treatment of some topics, the standard textbook in the field is
> M. Nielsen and I. Chuang. _Quantum Computation and Quantum Information_. Cambridge University Press, 2000.

- J. Preskill. _Ph219/CS219 Lecture Notes_. Available [here](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/index.html#lecture).
    + Some excellent lecture notes on quantum information theory.
- S. Aaronson. _Quantum Computing since Democritus_. Cambridge University Press, 2013. Complementary lecture notes also available [here](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/).
    + A bit more idiosyncratic and fun to read, but still very informative.
