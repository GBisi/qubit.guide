## Further reading

- P. Kaye, R. Laflamme, and M. Mosca. _An Introduction to Quantum Computing_. Oxford University Press, 2007.
    + This is probably the best textbook for this particular course.
- M. Nielsen and I. Chuang. _Quantum Computation and Quantum Information_. Cambridge University Press, 2000.
    + This is considered the standard textbook in the field. The book was published around 2000, so its treatment of some topics is dated, but there is still no better overview of the whole field.
- J. Preskill. _Ph219/CS219 Lecture Notes_. Available [here](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/index.html#lecture).
    + Some excellent lecture notes on quantum information theory.
- S. Aaronson. _Quantum Computing since Democritus_. Cambridge University Press, 2013. Complementary lecture notes also available [here](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/).
    + A bit more idiosyncratic and fun to read, but still very informative.
