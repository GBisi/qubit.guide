## To-do

1. write overview!
1. why are some captions above figures and some below?

1. `\newcommand`s to somewhere shared by tex **and** html output
1. svg output for figures
1. fix `fig.fullwidth` --- it doesn't seem to do anything?
1. license on index page
1. "view source" button on gitbook output
  + this is `view`: see <https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/configuration.html>
1. **pdf output**
1. switch to katex
  + gitbook _and_ tufte
1. `idea` environment (cf. e.g. the "Quantum decoherence" subsection)
1. change the link prefixed to gitbook TOC
1. do something for if `margin.fig=TRUE` but the output is gitbook
