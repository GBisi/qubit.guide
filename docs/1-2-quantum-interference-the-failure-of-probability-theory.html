<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Quantum interference (the failure of probability theory)</h2>
<p>Modern mathematical probability theory is based on three axioms, proposed by Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov (1903–1987) in his monograph with the impressive German title <em>Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung</em> (“Foundations of Probability Theory”).
The <strong>Kolmogorov axioms</strong> are simple and intuitive:<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> I always found it an interesting coincidence that the two basic ingredients of modern quantum theory, namely probability and complex numbers, were discovered by the same person, an extraordinary man of many talents: a gambling scholar by the name of Girolamo Cardano (1501–1576).</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Once you identify all elementary outcomes, or events, you may then assign probabilities to them.</li>
<li>Probability is a number between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and an event which is certain has probability <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the probability of any event can be calculated using a deceptively simple rule — the <strong>additivity axiom</strong>:
<em>Whenever an event can occur in several mutually exclusive ways, the probability for the event is the sum of the probabilities for each way considered separately.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Obvious, isn’t it?
So obvious, in fact, that probability theory was accepted as a mathematical framework theory, a language that can be used to describe actual physical phenomena.
Physics should be able to identify elementary events and assign numerical probabilities to them.
Once this is done we may revert to mathematical formalism of probability theory.
The Kolmogorov axioms will take care of the mathematical consistency and will guide us whenever there is a need to calculate probabilities of more complex events.
This is a very sensible approach, apart from the fact that it does not always work!
Today, we know that probability theory, as ubiquitous as it is, fails to describe many common quantum phenomena.
In order to see the need for quantum theory let us consider a simple experiment in which probability theory fails to give the right predictions.</p>
<div id="the-double-slit-experiment" class="section level3" number="1.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> The double slit experiment</h3>
<p>In a double slit experiment, a particle emitted from a source <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> can reach the detector <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> by taking two different paths, e.g. through an upper or a lower slit in a barrier between the source and the detector.
After sufficiently many repetitions of this experiment we can evaluate the frequency of clicks in the detector <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and show that it is inconsistent with the predictions based on probability theory.
Let us use the quantum approach to show how the discrepancy arises.</p>
<p>The particle emitted from a source <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> can reach detector <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> by taking two different paths, with amplitudes <span class="math inline">\(z_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_2\)</span> respectively.
We may say that the upper slit is taken with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_1=|z_1|^2\)</span> and the lower slit with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_2=|z_2|^2\)</span>.
These are two mutually exclusive events.
With the two slits open, probability theory declares (by the additivity axiom) that the particle should reach the detector with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_1+p_2= |z_1|^2+|z_2|^2\)</span>.
But this is not what happens experimentally!</p>
<p>Following the ``quantum rules’’, first we add the amplitudes and then we square the absolute value of the sum to get the probability.
Thus, the particle will reach the detector with probability
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  p = |z|^2
  &amp; = |z_1 + z_2|^2
\\&amp; = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2
      + z_1^\star z_2 + z_1 z_2^\star
\\&amp; = p_1 + p_2
      + |z_1||z_2|\left(
        e^{i(\varphi_2-\varphi_1)}
        + e^{-i(\varphi_2-\varphi_1)}
      \right)
\\&amp; = p_1 + p_2
      + 2 \sqrt{p_1 p_2} \cos(\varphi_2-\varphi_1)
\\&amp; = p_1 + p_2 + \mbox{interference terms}
\end{aligned}
\]</span>
where we have expressed the amplitudes in their polar forms
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  z_1 &amp;= |z_1|e^{i\varphi_1}
\\z_2 &amp;= |z_2|e^{i\varphi_2}.
\end{aligned}
\]</span>
The appearance of the interference terms marks the departure from the classical theory of probability.
The probability of any two seemingly mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities of the individual events, <span class="math inline">\(p_1 + p_2\)</span>, <em>modified</em> by the <strong>interference term</strong> <span class="math inline">\(2 \sqrt{p_1p_2}\cos(\varphi_2-\varphi_1)\)</span>.
Depending on the <strong>relative phase</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_2-\varphi_1\)</span>, the interference term can be either negative (which we call <strong>destructive</strong> interference) or positive (<strong>constructive</strong> interference), leading to either suppression or enhancement of the total probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>The algebra is simple; our focus is on the physical interpretation.
Firstly, note that the important quantity here is the <em>relative</em> phase <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_2-\varphi_1\)</span> rather than the individual values <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_2\)</span>.
This observation is not trivial at all.
If a particle reacts only to the difference of the two phases, each pertaining to a separate path, then it must have, somehow, experienced the two paths, right?
Thus we cannot say that the particle has travelled either through the upper or the lower slit, because it has travelled through <em>both</em>.
In the same way, quantum computers follow, in some tangible way, all computational paths simultaneously, producing answers that depend on all these alternative calculations.
Weird, but this is how it is!
Secondly, what has happened to the additivity axiom in probability theory — what is wrong with it?
One thing that is wrong is the assumption that the processes of taking the upper or the lower slit are mutually exclusive.
In reality, as we have just mentioned, the two transitions <em>both occur</em>, simultaneously.
However, we cannot learn this from probability theory, or any other a priori mathematical construct.
There is no fundamental reason why Nature should conform to the additivity axiom.<label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> According to the philosopher Karl Popper (1902–1994) a theory is genuinely scientific only if it is possible, in principle, to establish that it is false. Genuinely scientific theories are never finally confirmed because no matter how many confirming observations have been made observations that are inconsistent with the empirical predictions of the theory are always possible.</span>
We find out how nature works by making intelligent guesses, running experiments, checking what happens and formulating physical theories.
If our guess disagrees with experiments then it is wrong, so we try another intelligent guess, and another, etc.
Right now, quantum theory is the best guess we have: it offers good explanations and predictions that have not been falsified by any of the existing experiments.
This said, be assured that one day quantum theory will be falsified and we will have to start guessing again.</p>
