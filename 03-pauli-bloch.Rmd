> More about the Bloch sphere, via the omnipresent Pauli matrices, which can be described in a more algebraic way.

Let us further investigate the relations between single qubit unitary transformations, Pauli matrices, and rotations of regular three-dimensional vectors.
The goal is to be able to visualise sequences of unitary operations on a qubit as sequences of rotations, and to see the action of some quantum circuits without getting engaged in lengthy calculations.

Matrices form a vector space: you can add them, and you can multiply them by a scalar.
One possible choice of a basis in the vector space of $(2\times 2)$ matrices is the set of matrices $\{M_{00},M_{01},M_{10},M_{11}\}$, where the entries of $M_{ij}$ are all $0$ except for the $ij$-th entry, which is $1$.
However, it turns out that there is a different basis which offers lots of insights into the structure of the general single-qubit unitary transformations, namely $\{\id,X,Y,Z\}$, i.e. the identity matrix and the three Pauli matrices.
