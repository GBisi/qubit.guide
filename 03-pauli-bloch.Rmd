> More about the Bloch sphere, via the omnipresent Pauli matrices, which can be described in a more algebraic way.

Let me elaborate here on relations amongst single qubit unitary transformations, Pauli matrices and rotations of regular three dimensional vectors.
I want you to be able to visualise sequences of unitary operations on a qubit as sequences of rotations, and to see the action of some quantum circuits without getting engaged in lengthy calculations.
Matrices form a vector space: you can add them, and you can multiply them by a scalar.
One possible choice of a basis in this vector space is a set of matrices with a single entry equal to $1$ and all other entries $0$.
However, it turns out that for $(2\times 2)$ matrices there is another basis --- the three Pauli matrices along with the identity --- which offers lots of insights into the structure of the general single qubit unitary transformations.
