> More about the Bloch sphere, via the omnipresent Pauli matrices, which can be described in a more algebraic way.

Let us further investigate the relations between single qubit unitary transformations, Pauli matrices, and rotations of regular three-dimensional vectors.
The goal is to be able to visualise sequences of unitary operations on a qubit as sequences of rotations, and to see the action of some quantum circuits without getting engaged in lengthy calculations.

Matrices form a vector space: you can add them, and you can multiply them by a scalar.
One possible choice of a basis in the vector space of $(2\times 2)$ matrices is the set of matrices $\{M_{00},M_{01},M_{10},M_{11}\}$, where the entries of $M_{ij}$ are all $0$ except for the $ij$-th entry, which is $1$.
However, it turns out that there is a different basis which offers lots of insights into the structure of the general single-qubit unitary transformations, namely $\{\id,X,Y,Z\}$, i.e. the identity matrix and the three Pauli matrices.





## The Pauli matrices, algebraically

  | $\id$ | $X=\sigma_x$ | $Y=\sigma_y$ | $Z=\sigma_z$ |
  | :---: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
  | $\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$ | $\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}$ | $\begin{bmatrix}0&-i\\i&0\end{bmatrix}$ | $\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\1&-1\end{bmatrix}$ |

Recalling [Pauli operators], we know that the Pauli operators (as well as the identity operator) are unitary and Hermitian, square to the identity, and anti-commute.

Any $(2\times 2)$ complex matrix $A$ has a unique expansion of the form
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    A &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      a_0 + a_z & a_x - i a_y
    \\a_x +i a_y &  a_0 - a_z
    \end{bmatrix}
  \\&= a_0\id + a_x X + a_y Y + a_z Z
  \\&= a_0\id + \vec{a}\cdot\vec{\sigma}.
  \end{aligned}
(\#eq:pauli)
\end{equation}
for some complex numbers $a_0$, $a_x$, $a_y$, and $a_z$.
Here, $\vec{a}$ is a vector with three complex components $(a_x, a_y, a_z)$, and $\vec{\sigma}$ represents the "vector" of Pauli matrices $(\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z)$.
The algebraic properties of the Pauli matrices can be neatly compacted (see the exercises) into a single expression:

::: {.idea}
  The **multiplication rule**:
  $$
    (\vec{a}\cdot\vec{\sigma})\,(\vec{b}\cdot\vec{\sigma})
    = (\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b})\,\id + i(\vec{a}\times \vec{b})\cdot\vec{\sigma}.
  $$
:::

We also introduce the inner product of two matrices:

::: {.idea}
  The **Hilbert--Schmidt product**:
  $$
    (A|B) = \frac12 \tr A^\dagger B.
  $$
:::

Recall that the trace of a square matrix $A$, denoted by $\tr A$, is defined to be the sum of the elements on the main diagonal of $A$, and defines a linear mapping: for any scalars $\alpha$ and $\beta$,
$$
  \tr (\alpha A+\beta B) = \alpha\tr A +\beta\tr B.
$$
Moreover, the trace is invariant under _cyclic_ permutations: e.g.
$$
  \tr(ABC) = \tr(BCA) = \tr(CAB).
$$
Note, however, that this does _not_ imply that e.g. $\tr(ABC)=\tr(ACB)$.


### Exercises

1. Show that $\{\id,\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z\}$ is an orthonormal basis with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt product in the space of complex $(2\times 2)$ matrices.
2. Show that the coefficients $a_k$ (for $k=x,y,z$) in \@ref(eq:pauli) are given by the inner product $a_k = (\sigma_k|A) = \frac12\tr\sigma_k A$.
