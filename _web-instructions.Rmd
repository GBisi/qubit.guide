## Using the e-book {-}

This book has some functionality unique to the online version, accessed using the toolbar along the top of the window.
From left to right, the icons have the following use:

- <i class="fa fa-align-justify"></i> — Hide/show the table of contents
- <i class="fa fa-search"></i> — Search within the text of the book
- <i class="fa fa-font"></i> — Change font size, font face, and toggle dark mode
- <i class="fa fa-code"></i> — View the source file from which the currently viewed chapter is built on GitHub^[The GitHub-savvy of you can use this to create issues pointing out typos, mistakes, etc.]
- <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i> — Open the PDF version of the book in a new tab

The online version also has [the accompanying lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkespgaZN4gmu0nWNmfMflVRqw0VPkCGH) embedded from YouTube.
These videos are hidden by default, but can be shown by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-font"></i> icon wherever one appears.
The order of the videos generally differs from that of the written notes, so we have made our best efforts to include them in an order which makes sense relative to the chapters here.
For those wishing to really get familiar with this subject, we recommend separately watching the lecture videos following the order in [the linked playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkespgaZN4gmu0nWNmfMflVRqw0VPkCGH).

<!-- TO-DO: talk about the .technical divs -->

There are also some keyboard shortcuts: you can go to the previous/next section by using the right/left arrow keys `←`/`→`; toggle the table of contents with `s`; jump to the search bar with `f`.
