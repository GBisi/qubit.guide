## Information about this web version {-}

This book has some functionality unique to the online version, accessed using the toolbar along the top of the window.
From left to right, the icons have the following use:

1. Hide/show the table of contents
2. Search within the text of the book
3. Change font size, font face, and toggle dark mode
4. View the source file from which the currently viewed chapter is built on GitHub^[The GitHub-savvy of you can use this to create issues pointing out typos, mistakes, etc.]
5. Open the PDF version of the book in a new tab

The online version also has [the accompanying lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkespgaZN4gmu0nWNmfMflVRqw0VPkCGH) embedded from YouTube.
The order of the videos differs from the order of the written notes in places, so we have made our best efforts to include them in an order which makes sense relative to the chapters here, but for those wishing to really get familiar with this subject, we recommend separately watching the lecture videos following the order in [the linked playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkespgaZN4gmu0nWNmfMflVRqw0VPkCGH).
<!-- (TO-DO: make this happen!!) You can hide/show all lecture videos in a chapter by using the button at the very top of each page. -->

<!-- TO-DO: talk about the .technical divs -->

There are also some keyboard shortcuts: you can go to the previous/next section by using the right/left arrow keys `←`/`→`; toggle the table of contents with `s`; jump to the search bar with `f`.
