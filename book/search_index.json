The interdisciplinary nature of this topic, combined with the diverse backgrounds that different readers have, means that some may find some particular chapters easy, while others find them difficult. The following will be assumed as prerequisites1: elementary probability theory, complex numbers, vectors and matrices, tensor products, and Dirac bra-ket notation. A basic knowledge of quantum mechanics (especially in the simple context of finite dimensional state spaces, e.g. state vectors, composite systems, unitary matrices, Born rule for quantum measurements) and basic ideas of classical theoretical computer science (complexity theory) would be helpful, but are not essential. But just because you don’t know about some of these subjects, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you shouldn’t try following the notes anyway.↩︎ "],["syllabus.html", "Syllabus", " Syllabus Fundamentals of quantum theory addition of probability amplitudes, quantum interference, mathematical description of states and evolution of closed quantum systems (Hilbert space, unitary evolution), measurements (projectors, Born rule), Pauli matrices Distinguishability of quantum states The Bloch sphere parametrisation, action of quantum gates on the Bloch vector The definition of quantum entanglement (tensor product structure) The no-cloning theorem, and quantum teleportation Quantum gates e.g. phase gate, Hadamard, controlled-not, SWAP, the Hadamard-phase-Hadamard network, phase “kick-back” induced by controlled-U, phase “kick-back” induced by quantum Boolean function evaluation Quantum algorithms Deutsch, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon Bell’s theorem Quantum correlations, CHSH inequality, density matrices, partial trace, statistical mixture of pure states, Born rule for density matrices Quantum entanglement in terms of density matrices Completely positive maps Kraus operators, the Choi matrix, positive versus completely positive maps, partial-transpose The simple model of decoherence Quantum error correction of bit-flip and phase-flip errors "],["quantum-interference.html", "Chapter 1 Quantum interference", " Chapter 1 Quantum interference About complex numbers, called probability amplitudes, that, unlike probabilities, can cancel each other out, leading to quantum interference and qualitatively new ways of processing information. The classical theory of computation does not usually refer to physics. Pioneers such as Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, Emil Post, and Kurt Gödel managed to capture the correct classical theory by intuition alone and, as a result, it is often falsely assumed that its foundations are self-evident and purely abstract. They are not!2 The concepts of information and computation can be properly formulated only in the context of a physical theory — information is stored, transmitted and processed always by physical means. Computers are physical objects and computation is a physical process. Indeed, any computation, classical or quantum, can be viewed in terms of physical experiments, which produce outputs that depend on initial preparations called inputs. Once we abandon the classical view of computation as a purely logical notion independent of the laws of physics it becomes clear that whenever we improve our knowledge about physical reality, we may also gain new means of computation. Thus, from this perspective, it is not very surprising that the discovery of quantum mechanics in particular has changed our understanding of the nature of computation. In order to explain what makes quantum computers so different from their classical counterparts, we begin with the rudiments of quantum theory. Computation is a physical process. Computation is a physical process.

We replace positive numbers (probabilities) with complex numbers \\(z\\) (called probability amplitudes) such that the squares of their absolute values, \\(|z|^2\\), are interpreted as probabilities. The correspondence between probability amplitude \\(z\\) and probability \\(p=|z|^2\\) is known as Born’s Rule. The rules for combining amplitudes are very reminiscent of the rules for combining probabilities: Whenever something can happen in a sequence of independent steps, we multiply the amplitudes of each step. Whenever something can happen in several alternative ways, we add the amplitudes for each separate way. That’s it! These two rules are basically all you need to manipulate amplitudes in any physical process, no matter how complicated.3 They are universal and apply to any physical system, from elementary particles through atoms and molecules to white dwarfs stars. They also apply to information, since, as we have already emphasised, information is physical. The two rules look deceptively simple but, as you will see in a moment, their consequences are anything but trivial. We will, however, amend the two rules later on when we touch upon particle statistics.↩︎ "],["quantum-interference-the-failure-of-probability-theory.html", "1.2 Quantum interference: the failure of probability theory", " 1.2 Quantum interference: the failure of probability theory Modern mathematical probability theory is based on three axioms, proposed by Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov (1903–1987) in his monograph with the impressive German title Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung (“Foundations of Probability Theory”). The Kolmogorov axioms are simple and intuitive:4 Once you identify all elementary outcomes, or events, you may then assign probabilities to them. Probability is a number between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), and an event which is certain has probability \\(1\\). Last but not least, the probability of any event can be calculated using a deceptively simple rule — the additivity axiom: Whenever an event can occur in several mutually exclusive ways, the probability for the event is the sum of the probabilities for each way considered separately. Obvious, isn’t it? So obvious, in fact, that probability theory was accepted as a mathematical framework theory, a language that can be used to describe actual physical phenomena. Physics should be able to identify elementary events and assign numerical probabilities to them. Once this is done we may revert to mathematical formalism of probability theory. The Kolmogorov axioms will take care of the mathematical consistency and will guide us whenever there is a need to calculate probabilities of more complex events. This is a very sensible approach, apart from the fact that it does not always work! Today, we know that probability theory, as ubiquitous as it is, fails to describe many common quantum phenomena. In order to see the need for quantum theory let us consider a simple experiment in which probability theory fails to give the right predictions. 1.2.1 The double slit experiment In a double slit experiment, a particle emitted from a source \\(S\\) can reach the detector \\(D\\) by taking two different paths, e.g. through an upper or a lower slit in a barrier between the source and the detector. After sufficiently many repetitions of this experiment we can evaluate the frequency of clicks in the detector \\(D\\) and show that it is inconsistent with the predictions based on probability theory. Let us use the quantum approach to show how the discrepancy arises. The particle emitted from a source \\(S\\) can reach detector \\(D\\) by taking two different paths, with amplitudes \\(z_1\\) and \\(z_2\\) respectively. We may say that the upper slit is taken with probability \\(p_1=|z_1|^2\\) and the lower slit with probability \\(p_2=|z_2|^2\\). These are two mutually exclusive events. With the two slits open, probability theory declares (by the additivity axiom) that the particle should reach the detector with probability \\(p_1+p_2= |z_1|^2+|z_2|^2\\). But this is not what happens experimentally! Following the “quantum rules”, first we add the amplitudes and then we square the absolute value of the sum to get the probability. Thus, the particle will reach the detector with probability \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} p &amp;= |z|^2 \\\\&amp; = |z_1 + z_2|^2 \\\\&amp; = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + z_1^\\star z_2 + z_1 z_2^\\star \\\\&amp; = p_1 + p_2 + |z_1||z_2|\\left( e^{i(\\varphi_2-\\varphi_1)} + e^{-i(\\varphi_2-\\varphi_1)} \\right) \\\\&amp; = p_1 + p_2 + 2 \\sqrt{p_1 p_2} \\cos(\\varphi_2-\\varphi_1) \\\\&amp; = p_1 + p_2 + \\mbox{interference terms} \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] where we have expressed the amplitudes in their polar forms \\[ \\begin{aligned} z_1 &amp;= |z_1|e^{i\\varphi_1} \\\\z_2 &amp;= |z_2|e^{i\\varphi_2}. \\end{aligned} \\] The appearance of the interference terms marks the departure from the classical theory of probability. The probability of any two seemingly mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities of the individual events, \\(p_1 + p_2\\), modified by the interference term \\(2 \\sqrt{p_1p_2}\\cos(\\varphi_2-\\varphi_1)\\). Depending on the relative phase \\(\\varphi_2-\\varphi_1\\), the interference term can be either negative (which we call destructive interference) or positive (constructive interference), leading to either suppression or enhancement of the total probability \\(p\\). The algebra is simple; our focus is on the physical interpretation. Firstly, note that the important quantity here is the relative phase \\(\\varphi_2-\\varphi_1\\) rather than the individual values \\(\\varphi_1\\) and \\(\\varphi_2\\). This observation is not trivial at all. If a particle reacts only to the difference of the two phases, each pertaining to a separate path, then it must have, somehow, experienced the two paths, right? Thus we cannot say that the particle has travelled either through the upper or the lower slit, because it has travelled through both. In the same way, quantum computers follow, in some tangible way, all computational paths simultaneously, producing answers that depend on all these alternative calculations. Weird, but this is how it is! Secondly, what has happened to the additivity axiom in probability theory — what is wrong with it? One thing that is wrong is the assumption that the processes of taking the upper or the lower slit are mutually exclusive. In reality, as we have just mentioned, the two transitions both occur, simultaneously. However, we cannot learn this from probability theory, or any other a priori mathematical construct. There is no fundamental reason why Nature should conform to the additivity axiom. 5 We find out how nature works by making intelligent guesses, running experiments, checking what happens and formulating physical theories. If our guess disagrees with experiments then it is wrong, so we try another intelligent guess, and another, etc. Right now, quantum theory is the best guess we have: it offers good explanations and predictions that have not been falsified by any of the existing experiments. This said, be assured that one day quantum theory will be falsified and we will have to start guessing again. I always found it an interesting coincidence that the two basic ingredients of modern quantum theory, namely probability and complex numbers, were discovered by the same person, an extraordinary man of many talents: a gambling scholar by the name of Girolamo Cardano (1501–1576).↩︎ According to the philosopher Karl Popper (1902–1994) a theory is genuinely scientific only if it is possible, in principle, to establish that it is false. Genuinely scientific theories are never finally confirmed because no matter how many confirming observations have been made observations that are inconsistent with the empirical predictions of the theory are always possible.↩︎ "],["superpositions.html", "1.3 Superpositions", " 1.3 Superpositions Amplitudes are more than just tools for calculating probabilities: they tell us something about physical reality. When we deal with probabilities, we may think about them as numbers that quantify our lack of knowledge. Indeed, when we say that a particle goes through the upper or the lower slit with some respective probabilities it does go through one of the two slits, we just do not know which one. In contrast, according to quantum theory, a particle that goes through the upper and the lower slit with certain amplitudes does explore both of the two paths, not just one of them. This is a statement about a real physical situation, about something that is out there and something we can experiment with. The assumption that the particle goes through one of the two slits, but we do not know which one, is inconsistent with the experimental observations. We have to accept that apart from some easy to visualise states, also known as the basis states, such as the particle at the upper slit or the particle at the lower slit, there are infinitely many other states, all of them equally real, in which the particle is in a superposition of the two basis states. This rather bizarre picture of reality is the best we have at the moment, and it works, at least for now. Physicists write such states as 6 \\[ |\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha |\\text{at the upper slit}\\rangle +\\beta |\\text{at the lower slit}\\rangle, \\] meaning the particle at the upper slit with amplitude \\(\\alpha\\) and at the lower slit with amplitude \\(\\beta\\). Mathematically, you can think about this expression as a vector \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) in a two-dimensional complex vector space written in terms of the two basis vectors \\(|\\text{at the upper slit}\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\text{at the lower slit}\\rangle\\). You can also write this vector as a column vector with two complex entries \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), but then you have to explain the physical meaning of the basis states. Here, we use the \\(|\\cdot\\rangle\\) notation, introduced by Paul Dirac in the early days of the quantum theory as a useful way to write and manipulate vectors. In Dirac notation you can put into the box \\(|\\phantom{0}\\rangle\\) anything that serves to specify what the vector is. It could be \\(|\\uparrow\\rangle\\) for spin up and \\(|\\downarrow\\rangle\\) for spin down, or \\(|0\\rangle\\) for a quantum bit holding logical \\(0\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\) for a quantum bit holding logical \\(1\\), etc. As we shall see soon, there is much more to this notation. Dirac notation will likely be familiar to physicists, but may look odd to mathematicians or computer scientists. Love it or hate it (and I suggest the former), the notation is so common that you simply have no choice but to learn it, especially if you want to study anything related to quantum theory.↩︎ "],["interferometers.html", "1.4 Interferometers", " 1.4 Interferometers Many modern interference experiments are performed using internal degrees of freedom of atoms and ions. For example, Ramsey interferometry, named after American physicist Norman Ramsey, is a generic name for an interference experiment in which atoms are sent through two separate resonant interaction zones, known as Ramsey zones, separated by an intermediate dispersive interaction zone. Many beautiful experiments of this type were carried out in the 1990s in Serge Haroche’s lab at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. Rubidium atoms were sent through two separate interaction zones (resonant interaction in the first and the third cavity) separated by a phase inducing dispersive interaction zone (the central cavity). The atoms were subsequently measured, via a selective ionisation, and found to be in one of the two preselected energy states, here labeled as \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\). The fraction of atoms found in states \\(|0\\rangle\\) or \\(|1\\rangle\\) showed a clear dependence on the phase shifts induced by the dispersive interaction in the central cavity. In 2012 Serge Haroche and Dave Wineland shared the Nobel Prize in physics for “ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems.” Figure 1.1: A schematic diagram of a Ramsey interference experiment. The three rectangular boxes in Figure 1.1 represent three cavities, each cavity being an arrangement of mirrors which traps electromagnetic field (think about standing waves in between two mirrors). The oval shapes represent rubidium atoms with two preselected energy states labelled as \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\). Each atom is initially prepared in a highly excited internal energy state \\(|0\\rangle\\) and zips through the three cavities, from the left to the right. In each cavity the atom interacts with the cavity field. The first and the third cavities are, for all theoretical purposes, identical. Their frequencies are tuned to the resonant frequency of the atom, and the atom exchanges energy with the cavity, going back and forth between its energy states \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\). In contrast, in the second (central) cavity, the atom undergoes the so-called dispersive interaction: it is too off resonance to exchange energy with the field but its energy states “feel” the field and acquire phase shifts. After experiencing this well timed sequence of resonant–dispersive–resonant interactions, the energy of the atom is measured and the atom is found to be either in state \\(|0\\rangle\\) or state \\(|1\\rangle\\). The fraction of atoms that is found in state \\(|0\\rangle\\) or \\(|1\\rangle\\) shows a clear dependence on the phase shifts induced by the dispersive interaction in the central cavity. We can understand this interference better if we follow the two internal states of the atom as it moves through the three cavities. Figure 1.2: The Ramsey interferometer represented as an abstract diagram. It should be read from left to right. The line segments represent transitions between the two states, \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\), and the numbers are the corresponding probability amplitudes. Suppose we are interested in the probability that the atom, initially in state \\(|0\\rangle\\), will be found, after completing its journey through the three cavities, in state \\(|1\\rangle\\). As you can see in Figure 1.2, this can happen in two ways, as indicated by the two red paths connecting the input state \\(|0\\rangle\\) on the left with the output state \\(|1\\rangle\\) on the right. Again, let \\(U_{ij}\\) denote the probability amplitude that input \\(|j\\rangle\\) generates output \\(|i\\rangle\\) (for \\(i,j=0,1\\)). We can see from the diagram that \\[ \\begin{aligned} U_{10} &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} e^{i\\varphi_0}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} e^{i\\varphi_1}\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt2} \\\\&amp;= \\frac12 e^{i\\varphi_0} - \\frac12 e^{i\\varphi_1} \\\\&amp;= -ie^{i\\varphi/2}\\sin\\frac{\\varphi}{2}, \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(\\varphi = \\varphi_0-\\varphi_1\\) is the relative phase. The corresponding probability reads7 \\[ \\begin{aligned} P_{10} &amp;= \\vert U_{10}\\vert^2 \\\\&amp;= \\left\\vert \\frac12 e^{i\\varphi_0} - \\frac12 e^{i\\varphi_1}\\right\\vert^2 \\\\&amp;= \\frac12 - \\frac12\\cos\\varphi. \\end{aligned} \\] You should recognise the first term, \\(\\frac12\\), as the “classical” probability and the second one, \\(-\\frac12\\cos\\varphi\\), as the interference term. We can repeat such calculations for any other pair of input–output states. This approach works fine here but, in general, tracking all possible paths in evolving quantum systems can become messy when the number of input and output states increases. There is, however, a neat way of doing it via matrix multiplication. The effect of each interaction on atomic states can be described by a matrix of transition amplitudes, as illustrated in Figure 1.3. Then a sequence of independent interactions is described by the product of these matrices. \\[ \\begin{aligned} U &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} &amp; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\\\\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} &amp; \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt2} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} e^{i\\varphi_0} &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; e^{i\\varphi_1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} &amp; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\\\\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} &amp; \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt2} \\end{bmatrix} \\\\&amp;= e^{i\\frac{\\varphi_0+\\varphi_1}{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\frac{\\varphi}{2} &amp; -i\\sin\\frac{\\varphi}{2} \\\\\\ -i\\sin\\frac{\\varphi}{2}&amp; \\cos\\frac{\\varphi}{2} \\end{bmatrix}, \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(\\varphi = \\varphi_0-\\varphi_1\\). Figure 1.3: The Ramsey interferometer represented as an abstract diagram (matrix approach). Here we have omitted the \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\) labels, just to simply the diagram. We also ignore the global phase factor of \\(e^{i\\frac{\\varphi_0+\\varphi_1}{2}}\\). In general, quantum operation \\(A\\) followed by another quantum operation \\(B\\) is a quantum operation described by the matrix product \\(BA\\) (watch the order of matrices). Indeed, the expression \\((BA)_{ij}=\\sum_k B_{ik}A_{kj}\\) is the sum over amplitudes that input \\(|j\\rangle\\) generates output \\(|i\\rangle\\) via a specific intermediate state \\(|k\\rangle\\). As you can see, the matrix approach is a wonderful bookkeeping tool for in one swap it takes care of both multiplying and adding probability amplitudes corresponding to all the contributing paths. From the classical probability theory perspective the resonant interaction induces a random switch between \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\) (why ?) and the dispersive interaction has no effect on these two states (why ?). Hence, one random switch followed by another random switch gives a random switch, right, which gives \\(\\frac12\\) for the probability that input \\(|0\\rangle\\) becomes output \\(|1\\rangle\\).↩︎ "],["qubits-gates-and-circuits.html", "1.5 Qubits, gates, and circuits", " 1.5 Qubits, gates, and circuits Atoms, trapped ions, molecules, nuclear spins and many other quantum objects with two pre-selected basis states labeled as \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\) (from now on we will call such objects quantum bits or qubits) can be used to implement simple quantum interference. There is no need to learn about physics behind these diverse technologies if all you want is to understand the basics of quantum theory. We may now conveniently forget about any specific experimental realisation of a qubit and represent a generic single qubit interference graphically as a circuit diagram:8 This diagram should be read from left to right. The horizontal line represents a qubit that is inertly carried from one quantum operation to another. We often call this line a quantum wire. The wire may describe translation in space (e.g. atoms travelling through cavities) or translation in time (e.g. a sequence of operations performed on a trapped ion). The boxes or circles on the wire represent elementary quantum operations, called quantum logic gates. Here we have two types of gates: two Hadamard gates \\(H\\) (think about resonant interactions) and one phase gate \\(P_\\varphi\\) (think about dispersive interaction), where9 \\[ H=\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} &amp; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\\\\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} &amp; \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt2} \\end{bmatrix} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad P_\\varphi = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; e^{i\\varphi} \\end{bmatrix}. \\] The input qubits appear as state vectors on the left side of circuit diagrams, and the output qubits as state vectors on the right.

We hardly see quantum interference on a daily basis. Why? The answer is decoherence. The addition of probability amplitudes, rather than probabilities, applies to physical systems which are completely isolated. However, it is almost impossible to isolate a complex quantum system, such as a quantum computer, from the rest of the world. There will always be spurious interactions with the environment, and when we add amplitudes, we have to take into account not only different configurations of the physical system at hand, but also different configurations of the environment. For example, consider an isolated system composed of a quantum computer and its environment. The computer is prepared in some input state \\(I\\) and generates output \\(O\\). Let us look at the following two scenarios: The computer is isolated and quantum computation does not affect the environment. The computer and the environment evolve independently from each other and, as a result, the environment does not hold any physical record of how the computer reached output \\(O\\). In this case we add the amplitudes for each of the two alternative computational paths. Quantum computation affects the environment. The environment now holds a physical record of how the computer reached output \\(O\\), which results in two final states of the composed system (computer + environment) which we denote \\(O_1\\) and \\(O_2\\). We add the probabilities for each of the two alternative computational paths. When quantum computation affects the environment, we have to include the environment in our analysis for it now takes part in the computation. Depending on which computational path was taken, the environment may end up in two distinct states. The computer itself may show output \\(O\\), but when we include the environment we have not one, but two outputs, \\(O_1\\) and \\(O_2\\), denoting, respectively, “computer shows output \\(O\\) and the environment knows that path \\(1\\) was taken” and “computer shows output \\(O\\) and the environment knows that path \\(2\\) was taken”. There are no alternative ways of reaching \\(O_1\\) or \\(O_2\\), hence there is no interference, and the corresponding probabilities read \\(p_1=|z_1|^2\\) for \\(O_1\\), and \\(p_2=|z_2|^2\\) for \\(O_2\\). The probability that the computer shows output \\(O\\), regardless the state of the environment, is the sum of of the two probabilities: \\(p=p_1+p_2\\). We have lost the interference term and any advantages of quantum computation along with it. In the presence of decoherence the interference formula (1.1) is modified and reads \\[ p = p_1 + p_2 + 2 v \\sqrt{p_1 p_2}\\cos (\\varphi_2-\\varphi_1), \\] where the parameter \\(v\\), called the visibility of the interference pattern, ranges from \\(0\\) (the environment can perfectly distinguish between the two paths, total decoherence, no interference) to \\(1\\) (the environment cannot distinguish between the two paths, no decoherence, full interference), with the values in between corresponding to partial decoherence. We shall derive this formula later on, and you will see that \\(v\\) quantifies the degree of distinguishability between \\(O_1\\) and \\(O_2\\). The more the environment knows about which path was taken the less interference we see. Decoherence suppresses quantum interference. Decoherence is chiefly responsible for our classical description of the world — without interference terms we may as well add probabilities instead of amplitudes. While decoherence is a serious impediment to building quantum computers, depriving us of the power of quantum interference, it is not all doom and gloom: there are clever ways around decoherence, such as quantum error correction and fault-tolerant methods we will meet later. "],["computation-deterministic-probabilistic-and-quantum.html", "1.7 Computation: deterministic, probabilistic, and quantum", " 1.7 Computation: deterministic, probabilistic, and quantum Take one physical bit or a qubit. It has two logical states: \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\). Bring another qubit and the combined systems has four logical states \\(|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle,|10\\rangle\\) and \\(|11\\rangle\\). In general \\(n\\) qubits will give us \\(2^n\\) states representing all possible binary strings of length \\(n\\). It is important to use subsystems — here qubits — rather than one chunk of matter, for operating on at most \\(n\\) qubits we can reach any of the \\(2^n\\) states of the composed system. Now, let the qubits interact in a controllable fashion. We are computing. Think about computation as a physical process that evolves a prescribed initial configuration of a computing machine, called \\(\\texttt{INPUT}\\), into some final configuration, called \\(\\texttt{OUTPUT}\\). We shall refer to the configurations as states. Figure 1.4 shows five consecutive computational steps performed on four distinct states. Figure 1.4: Deterministic computation. That computation was deterministic: every time you run it with the same input, you get the same output. But a computation does not have to be deterministic — we can augment a computing machine by allowing it to “toss an unbiased coin” and to choose its steps randomly. It can then be viewed as a directed11 tree-like graph where each node corresponds to a state of the machine, and each edge represents one step of the computation, as shown in Figure 1.5 Figure 1.5: Probabilistic computation. The computation starts from some initial state (\\(\\texttt{INPUT}\\)) and it subsequently branches into other nodes representing states reachable with non-zero probability from the initial state. The probability of a particular final state (\\(\\texttt{OUTPUT}\\)) being reached is equal to the sum of the probabilities along all mutually exclusive paths which connect the initial state with that particular state. Figure 1.5 shows only two computational paths, but, in general, there could be many more paths (here, up to 256) contributing to the final probability. Quantum computation can be represented by a similar graph, as in 1.6. Figure 1.6: Quantum computation. For quantum computations, we associate with each edge in the graph the probability amplitude that the computation follows that edge. The probability amplitude of a particular path to be followed is the product of amplitudes pertaining to transitions in each step. The probability amplitude of a particular final state being reached is equal to the sum of the amplitudes along all mutually exclusive paths which connect the initial state with that particular state: \\[ z = \\sum_{\\mathrm{all\\,paths}\\,k} z_k. \\] The resulting probability, as we have just seen, is the sum of the probabilities pertaining to each computational path \\(p_k\\) modified by the interference terms: \\[ p = |z|^2 = \\sum_{k,j} z_j^\\star z_k = \\sum_k p_k + \\sum_{k\\ne j} \\sqrt{p_k p_j}\\cos(\\varphi_k-\\varphi_j). \\] Quantum computation can be viewed as a complex multi-particle quantum interference involving many computational paths through a computing device. The art of quantum computation is to shape quantum interference, through a sequence of computational steps, enhancing probabilities of correct outputs and suppressing probabilities of the wrong ones. So we read left to right, and omit the arrowheads.↩︎ "],["computational-complexity.html", "1.8 Computational complexity", " 1.8 Computational complexity Is there a compelling reason why we should care about quantum computation? It may sound like an extravagant way to compute something that can be computed anyway. Indeed, your standard laptop, given enough time and memory, can simulate pretty much any physical process. In principle, it can also simulate any quantum interference and compute everything that quantum computers can compute. The snag is, this simulation, in general, is very inefficient. And efficiency does matter, especially if you have to wait more than the age of the Universe for your laptop to stop and deliver an answer!12 In order to solve a particular problem, computers (classical or quantum) follow a precise set of instructions called an algorithm. Computer scientists quantify the efficiency of an algorithm according to how rapidly its running time, or the use of memory, increases when it is given ever larger inputs to work on. An algorithm is said to be efficient if the number of elementary operations taken to execute it increases no faster than a polynomial function of the size of the input.13 We take the input size to be the total number of binary digits (bits) needed to specify the input. For example, using the algorithm taught in elementary school, one can multiply two \\(n\\) digit numbers in a time that grows like the number of digits squared, \\(n^2\\). In contrast, the fastest-known method for the reverse operation — factoring an \\(n\\)-digit integer into prime numbers — takes a time that grows exponentially, roughly as \\(2^n\\). That is considered inefficient. The class of problems that can be solved by a deterministic computer in polynomial time is represented by the capital letter P, for polynomial time. The class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a probabilistic computer is called BPP, for bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time. It is clear that BPP contains P, since a deterministic computation is a special case of a probabilistic computation in which we never consult the source of randomness. When we run a probabilistic (a.k.a. randomised) computation many times on the same input, we will not get the same answer every time, but the computation is useful if the probability of getting the right answer is high enough. Finally, the complexity class BQP, for bounded-error quantum polynomial, is the class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a quantum computer. Since a quantum computer can easily generate random bits and simulate a probabilistic classical computer, BQP certainly contains the class BPP. Here we are interested in problems that are in BQP but not known to be in BPP. The most popular example of such a problem is factoring. A quantum algorithm, discovered by Peter Shor in 1994, can factor \\(n\\)-digit numbers in a number of steps that grows only as \\(n^2\\), as opposed to the \\(2^n\\) that we have classically.14 Since the intractability of factorisation underpins the security of many methods of encryption, Shor’s algorithm was soon hailed as the first `killer application’ for quantum computation: something very useful that only a quantum computer could do. Since then, the hunt has been on for interesting things for quantum computers to do, and at the same time, for the scientific and technological advances that could allow us to build quantum computers. The age of the Universe is currently estimated at 13.772 billion years.↩︎ Note that the technological progress alone, such as increasing the speed of classical computers, will never turn an inefficient algorithm (exponential scaling) into an efficient one (polynomial scaling). Why?↩︎ It must be stressed that not all quantum algorithms are so efficient, in fact many are no faster than their classical counterparts. Which particular problems will lend themselves to quantum speed-ups is an open question.↩︎ "],["outlook.html", "1.9 Outlook", " 1.9 Outlook When the physics of computation was first investigated, starting in the 1960s, one of the main motivations was a fear that quantum-mechanical effects might place fundamental bounds on the accuracy with which physical objects could render the properties of the abstract entities, such as logical variables and operations, that appear in the theory of computation. It turned out, however, that quantum mechanics itself imposes no significant limits, but does break through some of those that classical physics imposed. The quantum world has a richness and intricacy that allows new practical technologies, and new kinds of knowledge. In this course we will merely scratch the surface of the rapidly developing field of quantum computation. We will concentrate mostly on the fundamental issues and skip many experimental details. However, it should be mentioned that quantum computing is a serious possibility for future generations of computing devices. At present it is not clear how and when fully-fledged quantum computers will eventually be built; but this notwithstanding, the quantum theory of computation already plays a much more fundamental role in the scheme of things than its classical predecessor did. I believe that anyone who seeks a fundamental understanding of either physics, computation or logic must incorporate its new insights into their world view. "],["notes-and-exercises.html", "1.10 Notes and Exercises", " 1.10 Notes and Exercises 1.10.1 Back in 1926, Max Born simply postulated the connection between amplitudes and probabilities. However, it is worth pointing out that he did not get it quite right on his first approach. In the original paper15 proposing the probability interpretation of the state vector (wavefunction) he wrote: … If one translates this result into terms of particles only one interpretation is possible. \\(\\Theta_{\\eta,\\tau,m}(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)\\) [the wavefunction for the particular problem he is considering] gives the probability\\(^*\\) for the electron arriving from the \\(z\\) direction to be thrown out into the direction designated by the angles \\(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma\\)… \\(^*\\) Addition in proof: More careful considerations show that the probability is proportional to the square of the quantity \\(\\Theta_{\\eta,\\tau,m}(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)\\). 1.10.2 Complex numbers have many applications in physics, however, not until the advent of quantum theory was their ubiquitous and fundamental role in the description of the actual physical world so evident. Even today, their profound link with probabilities appears to be a rather mysterious connection. Mathematically speaking, the set of complex numbers is a field. This is an important algebraic structure used in almost all branches of mathematics. You do not have to know much about algebraic fields to follow these lectures, but still, you should know the basics. Look them up. The set of rational numbers and the set of real numbers are both fields, but the set of integers is not. Why? What does it mean to say that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed? Evaluate each of the following quantities: \\[ 1+e^{-i\\pi}, \\quad |1+i|, \\quad (1+i)^{42}, \\quad \\sqrt{i}, \\quad 2^i, \\quad i^i. \\] Here is a simple proof that \\(+1=-1\\): \\[1=\\sqrt{1}=\\sqrt{(-1)(-1)}=\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=i^2=-1.\\] What is wrong with it? 1.10.3 A quantum computer starts calculations in some initial state, then follows \\(n\\) different computational paths which lead to the final output. The computational paths are followed with probability amplitudes \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt n}e^{i k \\varphi}\\), where \\(\\varphi\\) is a fixed angle \\(0&lt; \\varphi &lt;2\\pi\\) and \\(k=0,1,...n-1\\). Show that the probability of generating the output is16 \\[ \\frac{1}{n}\\left\\vert \\frac{1-e^{i n\\varphi}}{1-e^{i\\varphi}} \\right\\vert^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{\\sin^2 (n\\frac{\\varphi}{2})}{\\sin^2 (\\frac{\\varphi}{2})}. \\] for \\(0&lt;\\varphi&lt;2\\pi\\), and \\(1\\) for \\(\\varphi=0\\). Plot the probability as a function of \\(\\varphi\\). 1.10.4 Imagine two distant stars, A and B, that emit identical photons. If you point a single detector towards them you will register a click every now and then, but you never know which star the photon came from. Now prepare two detectors and point them towards the stars. Assume the photons arrive with the probability amplitudes specified in Figure 1.7. Every now and then you will register a coincidence: the two detectors will fire. Calculate the probability of a coincidence. Now, assume that \\(z\\approx \\frac{1}{r}e^{i\\frac{2r\\pi}{\\lambda}}\\), where \\(r\\) is the distance between detectors and the stars. How can we use this to measure \\(r\\)? Figure 1.7: Two photon detectors pointing at two stars, with the probabilities of detection. 1.10.5 Physics against logic? Now that we have poked our heads into the quantum world, let us see how quantum interference challenges conventional logic and leads to qualitatively different computations. Consider the following task: design a logic gate that operates on a single bit such that when it is followed by another, identical, logic gate the output is always the negation of the input. Let us call this logic gate the square root of \\(\\texttt{NOT}\\) (\\(\\sqrt{\\texttt{NOT}}\\)). A simple check, such as an attempt to construct a truth table, should persuade you that there is no such operation in logic. It may seem reasonable to argue that since there is no such operation in logic, \\(\\sqrt{\\texttt{NOT}}\\) is impossible. Think again! Figure 1.8 shows a simple computation, two identical computational steps performed on two states labelled as \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), i.e. on one bit. An interplay of constructive and destructive interference makes some transitions impossible and the result is the logical \\(\\texttt{NOT}\\). Thus, quantum theory declares, the square root of \\(\\texttt{NOT}\\) is possible. And it does exist! Experimental physicists routinely construct this and many other “impossible” gates in their laboratories. They are the building blocks of a quantum computer. Quantum theory explains the behaviour of \\(\\sqrt{\\texttt{NOT}}\\), hence, reassured by the physical experiments that corroborate this theory, logicians are now entitled to propose a new logical operation \\(\\sqrt{\\texttt{NOT}}\\). Why? Because a faithful physical model for it exists in nature. Write a \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix which describes the \\(\\sqrt{\\texttt{NOT}}\\) operation. Is there just one such a matrix? Suppose you are given a supply of Hadamard and phase gates with tuneable phase settings. How would you construct the \\(\\sqrt{\\texttt{NOT}}\\) gate? Figure 1.8: A computation that, when repeated, gives exactly \\(\\texttt{NOT}\\). An unlabelled line means that it has probability \\(1\\), and the lack of a line corresponds to having probability \\(0\\). 1.10.6 Quantum Bomb Tester You have been drafted by the government to help in the demining effort in a former war-zone.17 In particular, retreating forces have left very sensitive bombs in some of the sealed rooms. The bombs are configured such that if even one photon of light is absorbed by the fuse (i.e. if someone looks into the room), the bomb will go off. Each room has an input and output port which can be hooked up to external devices. An empty room will let light go from the input to the output ports unaffected, whilst a room with a bomb will explode if light is shone into the input port and the bomb absorbs even just one photon — see Figure 1.9. Figure 1.9: Left — the passage of a photon through an empty room. Right — the passage of a photon through a room containing a bomb. Your task is to find a way of determining whether a room has a bomb in it without blowing it up, so that specialised (limited and expensive) equipment can be devoted to defusing that particular room. You would like to know with certainty whether a particular room had a bomb in it. To start with, consider the setup in Figure 1.10, where the input and output ports are hooked up in the lower arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.18 Assume an empty room. Send a photon to input port \\(|0\\rangle\\). Which detector, at the output port, will register the photon? Now assume that the room does contain a bomb. Again, send a photon to input port \\(|0\\rangle\\). Which detector will register the photon and with which probability? Design a scheme that allows you — at least some of the time — to decide whether a room has a bomb in it without blowing it up. If you iterate the procedure, what is its overall success rate for the detection of a bomb without blowing it up? Figure 1.10: The Mach-Zehnder interferometer hooked up to the bomb-testing room. Assume that the two beam splitters in the interferometer are different. Say the first beam-splitter reflects incoming light with probability \\(r\\) and transmits with probability \\(t=1-r\\), and the second one transmits with probability \\(r\\) and reflects with probability \\(t\\). Would the new setup improve the overall success rate of the detection of a bomb without blowing it up? There exists a scheme, involving many beam-splitters and something called the quantum Zeno effect, such that the success rate for detecting a bomb without blowing it up approaches 100%. Try to work it out, or find a solution on the internet. 1.10.7 A quantum machine has \\(N\\) perfectly distinguishable configurations. What is the maximum number of computational paths connecting a specific input with a specific output after \\(k\\) steps of the machine? Suppose you are using your laptop to add together amplitudes pertaining to each of the paths. As \\(k\\) and \\(N\\) increase you may need more time and more memory to complete the task. How does the execution time and the memory requirements grow with \\(k\\) and \\(N\\)? Will you need more time or more memory or both? 1.10.8 The classical theory of computation is essentially the theory of the universal Turing machine — the most popular mathematical model of classical computation. Its significance relies on the fact that, given a large but finite amount of time, the universal Turing machine is capable of any computation that can be done by any modern classical digital computer, no matter how powerful. The concept of Turing machines may be modified to incorporate quantum computation, but we will not follow this path. It is much easier to explain the essence of quantum computation talking about quantum logic gates and quantum Boolean networks or circuits. The two approaches are computationally equivalent, even though certain theoretical concepts, e.g. in computational complexity, are easier to formulate precisely using the Turing machine model. The main advantage of quantum circuits is that they relate far more directly to proposed experimental realisations of quantum computation. 1.10.9 In computational complexity the basic distinction is between polynomial and exponential algorithms. Polynomial growth is good and exponential growth is bad, especially if you have to pay for it. There is an old story about the legendary inventor of chess who asked the Persian king to be paid only by a grain of cereal, doubled on each of the 64 squares of a chess board. The king placed one grain of rice on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and he was supposed to keep on doubling until the board was full. The last square would then have \\(2^{63}=9,223,372,036,854,775,808\\) grains of rice, more than has been ever harvested on planet Earth, to which we must add the grains of all previous squares, making the total number about twice as large. If we placed that many grains in an unbroken line we would reach the nearest star Alpha Centauri, our closest celestial neighbour beyond the solar system, about \\(4.4\\) light-years away.19 The moral of the story: if whatever you do requires an exponential use of resources, you are in trouble. 1.10.10 In order to make qualitative distinctions between how different functions grow we will often use the asymptotic big-\\(O\\) notation. For example, suppose an algorithm running on input of size \\(n\\) takes \\(a n^2+bn+c\\) elementary steps, for some positive constants \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). These constants depend mainly on the details of the implementation and the choice of elementary steps. What we really care about is that, for large \\(n\\), the whole expression is dominated by its quadratic term. We then say that the running time of this algorithm grows as \\(n^2\\), and we write it as \\(O(n^2)\\), ignoring the less significant terms and the constant coefficients. More precisely, let \\(f(n)\\) and \\(g(n)\\) be functions from positive integers to positive reals. You may think of \\(f(n)\\) and \\(g(n)\\) as the running times of two algorithms on inputs of size \\(n\\). We say \\(f=O(g)\\),20 which means that \\(f\\) grows no faster than \\(g\\), if there is a constant \\(c&gt;0\\) such that \\(f(n)\\leqslant c g(n)\\) for all sufficiently large values of \\(n\\). Essentially, \\(f=O(g)\\) is a very loose analogue of \\(f \\leqslant g\\). In addition to the big-\\(O\\) notation, computer scientists often use \\(\\Omega\\) for lower bounds: \\(f=\\Omega (g)\\) means \\(g=O(f)\\). Again, this is a very loose analogue of \\(f \\geqslant g\\). When we say that \\(f(n)=O(\\log n)\\), why don’t we have to specify the base of the logarithm? Let \\(f(n)=5n^3+1000n+50\\). Is \\(f(n)=O(n^3)\\), or \\(O(n^4)\\), or both? Which of the following statements are true? \\(n^k=O(2^n)\\) for any constant \\(k\\) \\(n!=O(n^n)\\) if \\(f_1=O(g)\\) and \\(f_2=O(g)\\), then \\(f_1+f_2=O(g)\\). 1.10.11 There exists a randomised algorithm which tests whether a given number \\(N\\) is prime.21 The algorithm always returns \\(\\texttt{yes}\\) when \\(N\\) is prime, and the probability it returns \\(\\texttt{yes}\\) when \\(N\\) is not prime is \\(\\epsilon\\), which not greater than a half (independently, each time you run the algorithm). You run this algorithm (for the same \\(N\\)) \\(r\\) times and each time the algorithm returns \\(\\texttt{yes}\\). What is the probability that \\(N\\) is not prime? 1.10.12 Suppose a randomised algorithm solves a decision problem, returning \\(\\texttt{yes}\\) or \\(\\texttt{no}\\) answers. It gets the answer wrong with a probability not greater than \\(\\frac12-\\delta\\), where \\(\\delta&gt;0\\) is a constant.22. If we are willing to accept a probability of error no larger than \\(\\epsilon\\), then it suffices to run the computation \\(r\\) times, where \\(r=O(\\log 1/\\epsilon)\\).} If we perform this computation \\(r\\) times, how many possible sequences of outcomes are there? Give a bound on the probability of any particular sequence with \\(w\\) wrong answers. If we look at the set of \\(r\\) outcomes, we will determine the final outcome by performing a majority vote. This can only go wrong if \\(w&gt;r/2\\). Give an upper bound on the probability of any single sequence that would lead us to the wrong conclusion. Using the bound \\(1-x\\leq e^{-x}\\), conclude that the probability of our coming to the wrong conclusion is upper bounded by \\(e^{-2r\\delta^2}\\).

In fact, playing with mirrors and beam-splitters can give you lots of insights into the quantum world. A symmetric beam-splitter is a cube of glass which reflects half the light that impinges upon it, while allowing the remaining half to pass through unaffected. For our purposes it can be viewed as a device which has two input and two output ports which we label as \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\), as in 1.11. Figure 1.11: A beam-splitter. When we aim a single photon at such a beam-splitter using one of the input ports, we notice that the photon doesn’t split in two: we can place photo-detectors wherever we like in the apparatus, fire in a photon, and verify that if any of the photo-detectors registers a hit, none of the others do. In particular, if we place a photo-detector behind the beam-splitter in each of the two possible exit beams, the photon is detected with equal probability at either detector, no matter whether the photon was initially fired from input port \\(|0\\rangle\\) or \\(|1\\rangle\\). It may seem obvious that, at the very least, the photon is either in the transmitted beam \\(|0\\rangle\\) or in the reflected beam \\(|1\\rangle\\) during any one run of this experiment. Thus we may be tempted to think of the beam-splitter as a random binary switch which, with equal probability, transforms any binary input into one of the two possible outputs. However, that is not necessarily the case. Let us introduce a second beam-splitter and place two normal mirrors so that both paths intersect at the second beam-splitter, resulting in something resembling the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (see 1.12). Figure 1.12: Two beam-splitters with mirrors, so that a photon travels through both. Now, the axiom of additivity in probability theory says that whenever something can happen in several alternative ways we add probabilities for each way considered separately. We might argue that a photon fired into the input port \\(|0\\rangle\\) can reach the detector \\(0\\) in two mutually exclusive ways: either by two consecutive reflections or by two consecutive transmissions. Each reflection happens with probability \\(1/2\\) and each transmission happens with probability \\(1/2\\) thus the total probability of reaching detector 0 is a sum of the probability of the two consecutive reflections (\\(1/2\\times 1/2 = 1/4\\)) and the probability of the two consecutive transmissions (\\(1/2\\times 1/2 = 1/4\\)) which gives probability \\(1/2\\). This is summarised in 1.13, and makes perfect sense — a random switch followed by a random switch should give nothing else but a random switch. However, if we set up such an experiment, that is not what happens! There is no reason why probability theory or any other a priori mathematical construct should make any meaningful statements about outcomes of physical experiments. Figure 1.13: The two possible classical scenarios. Note that this is not what actually happens in the real physical world! In experimental reality, when the optical paths between the two beam-splitters are the same, the photon fired from input port \\(|0\\rangle\\) always strikes detector 1 and never detector 0 (and the photon fired from input port \\(|1\\rangle\\) always strikes detector 0 and never detector 1). Thus a beam-splitter acts as the square root of \\(\\texttt{NOT}\\) gate. The action of the beam-splitter — in fact, the action of any quantum device — can be described by tabulating the amplitudes of transitions between its input and output ports.23 \\[\\begin{equation} B = \\begin{bmatrix} B_{00} &amp; B_{01}\\\\ B_{10} &amp; B_{11} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} &amp; \\frac{i}{\\sqrt 2}\\\\ \\frac{i}{\\sqrt 2} &amp; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\end{bmatrix}. \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] The matrix element \\(B_{lk}\\), where \\(k,l=0,1\\), represents the amplitude of transition from input \\(|k\\rangle\\) to output \\(|l\\rangle\\) (watch the order of indices). Each reflection (entries \\(B_{01}\\) and \\(B_{10}\\)) happens with amplitude \\(i/\\sqrt{2}\\) and each transmission (entries \\(B_{00}\\) and \\(B_{11}\\)) happens with amplitude \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\). Thus the total amplitude that a photon fired from input port \\(|0\\rangle\\) will reach detector \\(0\\) is the sum of the amplitude of the two consecutive reflections (\\(i/\\sqrt{2}\\times i/{\\sqrt 2} = -1/2\\)) and the amplitude of the two consecutive transmissions (\\(1/{\\sqrt 2}\\times 1/{\\sqrt 2} = 1/2\\)) which gives the total amplitude \\(0\\). The resulting probability is then zero. Unlike probabilities, amplitudes can cancel out each other out. We can now go on and calculate the amplitude that the photon will reach detector \\(1\\). In this case we will get \\(i\\), which gives probability \\(1\\). We can then switch to input \\(|1\\rangle\\) and repeat our calculations. All possible paths and associated amplitudes are shown in 1.14. Figure 1.14: All possible transitions and their amplitudes when we compose two beam-splitters \\(B\\). However, instead of going through all the paths in this diagram and linking specific inputs to specific outputs, we can simply multiply the transition matrices: \\[ BB = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} &amp; \\frac{i}{\\sqrt 2}\\\\ \\frac{i}{\\sqrt 2} &amp; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} &amp; \\frac{i}{\\sqrt 2}\\\\ \\frac{i}{\\sqrt 2} &amp; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; i\\\\ i &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} = iX \\] where \\(X=\\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;1\\\\1&amp;0\\end{bmatrix}\\) is the \\(\\texttt{NOT}\\) operator.

Figure 1.15: The Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with the input photon represented by the coloured dot. This experimental set-up is named after the physicists Ludwig Mach and Ludwig Zehnder, who proposed it back in 1890s. It consists of two beam-splitters (the square boxes, bottom left and top right) and two slivers of glass of different thickness which are inserted into each of the optical paths connecting the two beam-splitters. The slivers are usually referred to as “phase shifters” and their thicknesses, \\(\\varphi_0\\) and \\(\\varphi_1\\), are measured in units of the photon’s wavelength multiplied by \\(2\\pi\\). The two inputs ports of the interferometer are labelled as \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\), and each of the two output ports, also labelled as \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), terminates in a photodetector.24 A photon (the coloured dot in the figure) impinges on the first beam-splitter from one of the two input ports (here input 1) and begins its journey towards one of the two photodetectors. Let25 \\(U_{ij}\\) denote the probability amplitude that the photon initially in input port \\(j=0,1\\) ends up in detector \\(i=0,1\\). At each of the two beam-splitters the photon is transmitted with the probability amplitude \\(\\sqrt{T}\\) and reflected with the probability amplitude \\(i\\sqrt{R}\\), with \\(R+T=1\\), and the two phase shifters modify the amplitudes by phase factors \\(e^{i\\varphi_0}\\) and \\(e^{i\\varphi_1}\\), respectively. In quantum theory we almost always start with the amplitudes, and once we have a full expression for the amplitude of a given outcome we square its absolute value to get the corresponding probability. For example, let us calculate \\(U_{00}\\). We notice that there are two alternative ways for the photon in the input port \\(0\\) to end up in the output port \\(0\\). It can take the lower path, through the phase shifter \\(\\varphi_0\\), or the upper path, through the phase shifter \\(\\varphi_1\\). The lower path implies two consecutive transmissions at the beam-splitters and the phase factor \\(e^{i\\varphi_0}\\), whereas the upper path implies two consecutive reflections and the phase factor \\(e^{i\\varphi_1}\\). Once the photon ends in the output port \\(0\\) there is no way of knowing which path was taken, thus we add the amplitudes pertaining to each path. The resulting amplitude is \\[ U_{00} = \\sqrt{T} e^{i\\varphi_0} \\sqrt{T} + i\\sqrt{R} e^{i\\varphi_1} i \\sqrt{R}, \\] and the corresponding probability \\(P_{00}=|U_{00}|^2\\) reads \\[ \\begin{aligned} P_{00} &amp; = \\left\\vert \\sqrt{T}e^{i\\varphi_0}\\sqrt{T} + i\\sqrt{R}e^{i\\varphi_1}i\\sqrt{R} \\right\\vert^2 = \\left\\vert Te^{i\\varphi_0} - Re^{i\\varphi_1} \\right\\vert^2 \\\\&amp; = T^2 + R^2 - 2TR\\cos(\\varphi_1-\\varphi_0). \\end{aligned} \\] The “classical” part of this expression, \\(T^2+R^2\\), basically says that the photon undergoes either two consecutive transmissions with probability \\(T^2\\), or two consecutive reflections with probability \\(R^2\\). The probability of being transmitted through any phase shifter is always \\(1\\), hence the phase shifters play no role in the classical description of this process. But the classical description is not correct, as the experiments show, whence the interference term \\(2TR\\cos(\\varphi_1-\\varphi_0)\\) in which the phase shifters play the essential role. Depending on the relative phase \\(\\varphi=\\varphi_1-\\varphi_0\\) the probability that the detector \\(0\\) “clicks” can vary from \\((T-R)^2\\), for \\(\\varphi=0\\), to \\(1\\), for \\(\\varphi=\\pi\\). If we do not care about the experimental details, we can represent the action of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer in terms of a diagram: see 1.16. Figure 1.16: The Mach-Zehnder interferometer represented as an abstract diagram. Here we can follow, from left to right, the multiple different paths that a photon can take in between specific input and output ports. The amplitude along any given path is just the product of the amplitudes pertaining to the path segments (Rule 1), while the overall amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes for the many different paths (Rule 2). You can, for example, see that the probability amplitude \\(U_{10}\\) is given by \\[ U_{10} = \\sqrt{T}e^{i\\varphi_0}i\\sqrt{R} + i\\sqrt{R}e^{i\\varphi_1}\\sqrt{T} \\] and the corresponding probability is \\[ \\begin{aligned} P_{10} &amp; = \\left\\vert \\sqrt{T}e^{i\\varphi_0}i\\sqrt{R} + i\\sqrt{R}e^{i\\varphi_1}\\sqrt{T} \\right\\vert^2 \\\\&amp; = 2RT + 2RT\\cos(\\varphi_1-\\varphi_0). \\end{aligned} \\] Again, the first term is of “classical” origin and represents probabilities corresponding to each path: one reflection followed by one transmission plus one transmission followed by one reflection, that is, \\(RT+TR=2RT\\). The second term is the interference term.

Consider, for example, a qubit. No quantum state of a qubit can be an eigenstate of two non-commuting operators, say \\(\\sigma_x\\) and \\(\\sigma_z\\). If the qubit has a definite value of \\(\\sigma_x\\) its value of \\(\\sigma_z\\) must be indeterminate, and vice versa. If we take quantum theory to be a complete description of the world, then we must accept that it is impossible for both \\(\\sigma_x\\) and \\(\\sigma_z\\) to have definite values for the same qubit at the same time. Einstein felt very uncomfortable about all this. He argued that quantum theory is incomplete, and that observables \\(\\sigma_x\\) and \\(\\sigma_z\\) may both have simultaneous definite values, although we only have knowledge of one of them at a time. This is the hypothesis of hidden variables. In this view, the indeterminacy found in quantum theory is merely due to our ignorance of these “hidden variables” that are present in nature but not accounted for in the theory. Einstein came up with a number of pretty good arguments for the existence of “hidden variables”. Probably the most compelling one was described in his 1935 paper (known as the EPR paper), co-authored with his younger colleagues, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. It stood for almost three decades as the most significant challenge to the completeness of quantum theory. Then, in 1964, John Bell showed that the hidden variable hypothesis can be tested and refuted. "],["chsh-inequality.html", "6.3 CHSH inequality", " 6.3 CHSH inequality Upper bound on classical correlations. I will describe the most popular version of Bell’s argument, introduced in 1969 by John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard Holt (CHSH). Let us assume that the results of any measurement on any individual system are predetermined. Any probabilities we may use to describe the system merely reflect our ignorance of these hidden variables. Now, imagine the following scenario. Alice and Bob, two characters with a predilection for wacky experiments, are equipped with appropriate measuring devices and sent to two distant locations. Somewhere in between them there is a source that emits pairs of qubits that fly apart, one towards Alice and one towards Bob. Let us label the two qubits in each pair as \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) respectively, and let us assume that both Alice and Bob have well defined values of their observables. We ask Alice and Bob to measure one of the two pre-agreed observables. For each incoming qubit, Alice and Bob choose randomly, and independently from each other, which particular observable will be measured. Alice chooses between \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), and Bob between \\(B_1\\) and \\(B_2\\). Each observable has value \\(+1\\) or \\(-1\\), and so we are allowed to think about them as random variables \\(A_k\\) and \\(B_k\\), for \\(k=1,2\\), which take values \\(\\pm 1\\). Let us define a new random variable, the CHSH quantity \\(S\\), as \\[ S = A_1(B_1 - B_2) + A_2(B_1 + B_2). \\] It is easy to see that one of the terms \\(B_1\\pm B_2\\) must be equal to zero and the other to \\(\\pm 2\\), hence \\(S=\\pm2\\). The average value of \\(S\\) must lie somewhere in-between, i.e. \\[ -2 &lt; \\langle S\\rangle &lt; 2. \\] That’s it! Such a simple and yet profound mathematical statement about correlations, which we refer simply to as the CHSH inequality. No quantum theory is involved because the CHSH inequality is not specific to quantum theory: it does not really matter what kind of physical process is behind the appearance of binary values of \\(A_1\\), \\(A_2\\), \\(B_1\\), and \\(B_2\\); it is a statement about correlations, and for all classical correlations we must have \\[ | \\langle A_1 B_1\\rangle - \\langle A_1 B_2\\rangle + \\langle A_2 B_1\\rangle + \\langle A_2 B_2\\rangle | &lt; 2. \\] There are essentially two two assumptions here: Hidden variables. Observables have definite values Locality. Alice’s choice of measurements (\\(A_1\\) or \\(A_2\\)) does not affect the outcomes of Bob’s measurement, and vice versa. I will not discuss the locality assumption here in detail but let me comment on it briefly. In the hidden variable world a, statement such as “if Bob were to measure \\(B_1\\) then he would register \\(+1\\)” must be either true or false prior to Bob’s measurement. Without the locality hypothesis, such a statement is ambiguous, since the value of \\(B_1\\) could depend on whether \\(A_1\\) or \\(A_2\\) will be chosen by Alice. We do not want this for it implies the instantaneous communication. It means that, say, Alice by making a choice between \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), affects Bob’s results. Bob can immediately “see” what Alice “does”. "],["quantum-correlations-revisited.html", "6.4 Quantum correlations revisited", " 6.4 Quantum correlations revisited In quantum theory the observables \\(A_1\\), \\(A_2\\), \\(B_1\\), \\(B_2\\) become \\(2\\times 2\\) Hermitian matrices with two eigenvalues \\(\\pm 1\\), and \\(\\langle S\\rangle\\) becomes the expected value of the \\(4\\times 4\\) CHSH matrix \\[ S = A_1\\otimes(B_1-B_2) + A_2\\otimes(B_1+B_2). \\] We can now evaluate \\(\\langle S\\rangle\\) using quantum theory.

And this, to be sure, has been observed in a number of painstakingly careful experiments. The early efforts were truly heroic, and the experiments had many layers of complexity. Today, however, such experiments are routine. Motto. The behaviour of entangled quantum systems cannot be explained by any local hidden variables.

As an example, consider an object composed of three qubits and the subspace \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) spanned by the two basis vectors \\(|000\\rangle\\) and \\(|111\\rangle\\). Suppose Eve applies one of the following four unitary operations: \\(U_0=\\operatorname{id}\\otimes\\operatorname{id}\\otimes \\operatorname{id}\\), \\(U_1 =X\\otimes\\operatorname{id}\\otimes \\operatorname{id}\\), \\(U_2 =\\operatorname{id}\\otimes X\\otimes \\operatorname{id}\\), and \\(U_3=\\operatorname{id}\\otimes\\operatorname{id}\\otimes X\\). That is, the identity, or bit-flip on the first, second, or third qubit. Each operation is chosen randomly with the same probability of \\(1/4\\). It is easy to see that the four operations generate four subspaces: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{C} = \\Big\\langle|000\\rangle,|111\\rangle\\Big\\rangle &amp;\\qquad \\mathcal{C}_1 = \\Big\\langle|100\\rangle,|011\\rangle\\Big\\rangle \\\\\\mathcal{C}_2 = \\Big\\langle|010\\rangle,|101\\rangle\\Big\\rangle&amp; \\qquad \\mathcal{C}_3 = \\Big\\langle|001\\rangle,|110\\rangle\\Big\\rangle. \\end{aligned} \\] The eight dimensional Hilbert space of the three qubits is then decomposed into the sum of orthogonal subspaces \\[ \\mathcal{C} \\oplus \\mathcal{C}_1 \\oplus\\mathcal{C}_2 \\oplus \\mathcal{C}_3 \\] So suppose Alice prepares \\(|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|000\\rangle+\\beta|111\\rangle\\) and Eve applies the bit-flip to the third qubit. This generates the state \\(\\operatorname{id}\\otimes\\operatorname{id}\\otimes X|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|001\\rangle+\\beta|110\\rangle\\in \\mathcal{C}_3\\). The projective measurement on these subspaces tells Bob that the new state is in the subspace \\(\\mathcal{C}_3\\), and hence the original state can be recovered by the operation \\(\\operatorname{id}\\otimes\\operatorname{id}\\otimes X\\). "],["repetition-codes.html", "7.7 Repetition codes", " 7.7 Repetition codes In order to give a sense of how quantum error correction actually works, let us begin with a classical example of a repetition code. Suppose a transmission channel flips each bit in transit with probability \\(p\\). If this error rate is considered too high then it can be decreased by encoding each bit into, say, three bits: \\[ \\begin{aligned} 0 &amp;\\mapsto 000 \\\\1 &amp;\\mapsto 111. \\end{aligned} \\] That is, each time we want to send logical \\(0\\), we send three physical bits, all in state \\(0\\); each time we want to send logical \\(1\\), we send three physical bits, all in state \\(1\\). The receiver decodes the bit value by a “majority vote” of the three bits. If only one error occurs, then this error correction procedure is foolproof. In general, the net probability of error is just the likelihood that two or three errors occur, which is \\(3p^2(1-p) + p^3 &lt; p\\). Thus the three bit code improves the reliability of the information transfer. The quantum case, however, is more complicated, because we have both bit-flip and phase-flip errors. "],["quantum-error-correction.html", "7.8 Quantum error correction", " 7.8 Quantum error correction In order to protect a qubit against bit-flips (incoherent \\(X\\) rotations), we rely on the same repetition code, but both encoding and error correction is now done by quantum operations. We take a qubit in some unknown pure state \\(\\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle\\), introduce two auxiliary qubits, and encode it into three qubits as Suppose that at most one qubit is then flipped (say, the second one). The encoded state then becomes \\(\\alpha|010\\rangle + \\beta|101\\rangle\\). Decoding requires some care: if we measure the three qubits directly it would destroy the superposition of states that we are working so hard to protect. Instead we introduce another two additional qubits, both in state \\(|0\\rangle\\), and apply the following network: We measure the two auxiliary qubits, also known as ancilla bits, and the result of the measurement, known as the error syndrome, tells us how to reset the three qubits of the code. The theory behind this network runs as follows. If qubits one and two (counting from the top) are the same, then the first ancilla is in the \\(|0\\rangle\\) state. Similarly, if qubits two and three are the same, then the second ancilla is in the \\(|0\\rangle\\) state. However, if they are different, then the corresponding ancilla is in the \\(|1\\rangle\\) state. Hence, the four possible error syndromes — \\(|00\\rangle\\), \\(|01\\rangle\\), \\(|10\\rangle\\), and \\(|11\\rangle\\) — each indicate a different possibility: no errors, an error in the third, first, or second qubits (respectively). In our example, we would measure \\(|11\\rangle\\), revealing that both qubits 1 and 2, and qubits 2 and 3, are different. Thus it is qubit 2 that has an error. Knowing the error, we can go back and fix it, simply by applying \\(X\\) to qubit 2. The net result is the state \\(\\alpha|000\\rangle + \\beta|111\\rangle\\), which is then turned into \\((\\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle)|0\\rangle|0\\rangle\\) by running the mirror image of the encoding network.

If we want to preserve a quantum state for a long time without doing any computations, or if we want to send it through a noisy communications channel, we can just encode the state using a quantum code and decode it when we are done.

"],["density-matrices.html", "Chapter 8 Density matrices", " Chapter 8 Density matrices We cannot always assign a definite state vector to a quantum system. It may be that the system is part of a composite system that is in an entangled state, or it may be that our knowledge of the preparation of a particular system is insufficient to determine its state. For example, someone may prepare a particle in one of the states \\(|\\psi_1\\rangle, |\\psi_2\\rangle, \\ldots, |\\psi_n\\rangle\\), with (respective) probabilities \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\). Nevertheless, in either case we are able to make statistical predictions about the outcomes of measurements performed on the system using a more general description of quantum states: density operators. We have already mentioned that the existence of entangled states begs an obvious question: if we cannot attribute a state vectors to an individual quantum system then how shall we describe its quantum state? In this lecture we will introduce an alternate description of quantum states that can be applied both to a composite system and to any of its subsystems. Our new mathematical tool is called a density operator.30 We will start with the density operator as a description of the mixture of quantum states. We will then discuss the partial trace, which is a unique operation that takes care of the reduction of a density operator of a composite system to density operators of its components. If we choose a particular basis, operators become matrices. Here I will use both terms (density operators and density matrices) interchangeably.↩︎ "],["definition.html", "8.1 Definition", " 8.1 Definition If you are an impatient mathematically minded person, who feels more comfortable when things are properly defined right from the beginning, here is your definition:31 A density operator \\(\\rho\\) on a finite dimensional Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) is any non-negative self-adjoint operator with trace equal to one. It follows that any such \\(\\rho\\) can always be diagonalised, that the eigenvalues are all real and non-negative, and that the eigenvalues sum to one. Moreover, given two density operators \\(\\rho_1\\) and \\(\\rho_2\\), we can always construct another density operator as a convex sum of the two: \\[ \\rho = p_1\\rho_1 + p_2\\rho_2 \\qquad\\text{where}\\quad p_1, p_2 \\geq 0 \\text{ and } p_1+p_2 = 1. \\] You should check that \\(\\rho\\) has all the defining properties of a density matrix, i.e. that it is self-adjoint, non-negative, and that its trace is one. This means that density operators form a convex set.32 An important example of a density operator is a rank one projector.33 Any quantum state that can be described by the state vector \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\), called a pure state, can be also described by the density operator \\(\\rho=|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|\\). Pure states are the extremal points in the convex set of density operators: they cannot be expressed as a convex sum of other elements in the set. In contrast, all other states, called mixed states, can be always written as the convex sum of pure states: \\(\\sum_i p_i |\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i|\\) (\\(p_i\\geq 0\\) and \\(\\sum_i p_i=1\\)). Now that we have cleared the mathematical essentials, we will turn to physical applications. A self-adjoint matrix \\(M\\) is said to be non-negative, or positive semi-definite, if \\(\\langle v|M|v\\rangle\\geq 0\\) for any vector \\(|v\\rangle\\), or if all of its eigenvalues are non-negative, or if here exists a matrix \\(A\\) such that \\(M=A^\\dagger A\\). (This is called a Cholesky factorization.)↩︎ A subset of a vector space is said to be convex if, for any two points in the subset, the straight line segment joining them is also entirely contained inside the subset.↩︎ The rank of a matrix is the number of its non-zero eigenvalues.↩︎ "],["mixtures.html", "8.2 Mixtures", " 8.2 Mixtures Let us start with probability distributions over state vectors. Suppose Alice prepares a quantum system and hands it over to Bob who subsequently measures observable \\(M\\). If Alice’s preparation is described by a state vector \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\), then, quantum theory declares, the average value of any observable \\(M\\) is given by \\(\\langle\\psi|M|\\psi\\rangle\\), which can be also written as34 \\[ \\langle M\\rangle = \\operatorname{tr}M|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|. \\] This way of expressing the average value makes a clear separation between the contributions from the state preparation and from the choice of the measurement. We have two operators under the trace: one of them, \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|\\), describes the state preparation, and the other one, \\(M\\), the measurement. Now, suppose Alice prepares the quantum system in one of the states \\(|\\psi_1\\rangle,\\ldots,|\\psi_m\\rangle\\), choosing state \\(|\\psi_i\\rangle\\) with probability \\(p_i\\), and hands the system to Bob without telling him which state was chosen. The possible states \\(|\\psi_i\\rangle\\) are normalised but need not be orthogonal. We call this situation a mixture of the states \\(|\\psi_i\\rangle\\), or a mixed state for short. Remember, a mixture of states is very different from a superposition of states: a superposition always yields a definite state vector, whereas a mixture does not, and so must be described by a density operator. Bob knows the ensemble of states \\(|\\psi_1\\rangle,\\ldots,|\\psi_m\\rangle\\) and the corresponding probability distribution \\(p_1,\\ldots,p_m\\), and can hence calculate \\(\\langle M\\rangle\\) as35 \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\langle M\\rangle &amp;= \\sum_i p_i\\left( \\operatorname{tr}M|\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i| \\right) \\\\&amp;= \\operatorname{tr}M \\underbrace{\\left( \\sum_i p_i|\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i| \\right)}_{\\rho} \\\\&amp;=\\operatorname{tr}M\\rho. \\end{aligned} \\] Again, we have two operators under the trace: \\(\\rho=\\sum_i p_i|\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i|\\), which pertains to the state preparation, and \\(M\\), which describes the measurement. We shall call the operator \\[ \\rho = \\sum_i p_i |\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i| \\] the density operator, since it has all the defining properties of the density operator (the convex sum of rank one projectors). It depends on the constituent states \\(|\\psi_i\\rangle\\) and their probabilities, and it describes our ignorance about the state preparation. Once we have \\(\\rho\\) we can make statistical predictions: for any observable \\(M\\) we have \\[ \\langle M\\rangle = \\operatorname{tr}M\\rho. \\] We see that the exact composition of the mixture does not enter this formula: for computing the statistics associated with any observable property of a system, all that matters is the density operator itself, and not its decomposition into the mixture of states. This is important because any given density operator, with the remarkable exception of a pure state, can arise from many different mixtures of pure states. Consider, for example, the following three scenarios: Alice flips a fair coin. If the result is \\(\\texttt{Heads}\\) then she prepares the qubit in the state \\(|0\\rangle\\), and if the result is \\(\\texttt{Tails}\\) then she prepares the qubit in the state \\(|1\\rangle\\). She gives Bob the qubit without revealing the result of the coin-flip. Bob’s knowledge of the qubit is described by the density matrix \\[ \\frac12|0\\rangle\\langle 0| + \\frac12|1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac12 &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; \\frac12 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Suppose Alice flips a fair coin, as before, but now if the result is \\(\\texttt{Heads}\\) then she prepares the qubit in the state \\(|\\bar{0}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)\\), and if the result is \\(\\texttt{Tails}\\) then she prepares the qubit in the state \\(|\\bar{1}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)\\).

As you can see, these three different preparations yield precisely the same density matrix and are hence statistically indistinguishable. In general, two different mixtures can be distinguished (in a statistical sense) if and only if they yield different density matrices. In fact, the optimal way of distinguishing quantum states with different density operators is still an active area of research. If \\(M\\) is one of the orthogonal projectors \\(P_k\\) describing the measurement, then the average \\(\\langle P_k\\rangle\\) is the probability of the outcome \\(k\\) associated with this projector.↩︎ A pure state can be seen as a special case of a mixed state, where all but one the probabilities \\(p_i\\) equal zero.↩︎ "],["a-few-instructive-examples-and-some-less-instructive-remarks.html", "8.3 A few instructive examples, and some less instructive remarks", " 8.3 A few instructive examples, and some less instructive remarks The density matrix corresponding to the state vector \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) is the rank one projector \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|\\).

One of the two measurements is completely useless. Which one, and why? In general, the diagonal entries of a density matrix describe the probability distributions on the set of basis vectors. They must add up to one, which is why the trace of any density matrix is one. The off-diagonal elements, often called coherences, signal departure from the classical probability distribution and quantify the degree to which a quantum system can interfere (we will discuss this in detail later on). The process in which off-diagonal entries (the parameter \\(\\epsilon\\) in the matrices below) go to zero is called decoherence. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} |\\alpha|^2 &amp; \\alpha\\beta^\\star \\\\\\alpha^\\star\\beta &amp; |\\beta|^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\mapsto \\begin{bmatrix} |\\alpha|^2 &amp; \\epsilon \\\\\\epsilon^\\star &amp; |\\beta|^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\mapsto \\begin{bmatrix} |\\alpha|^2 &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; |\\beta|^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] For \\(\\epsilon = \\alpha\\beta^\\star\\) we have a pure quantum state (“full interference capability”) and for \\(\\epsilon=0\\) we have a classical probability distribution over the standard basis (“no interference capability”).

For qubits, any pair of orthogonal states taken with equal probabilities gives the maximally mixed state \\(\\frac12\\operatorname{id}\\).

Which Bloch vectors yield legitimate density operators? Let us compute the eigenvalues of \\(\\rho\\). The sum of the two eigenvalues of \\(\\rho\\) is, of course, equal to one (\\(\\operatorname{tr}\\rho=1\\)) and the product is equal to the determinant of \\(\\rho\\), which can be computed from the matrix form above: \\[ \\det\\rho = \\frac{1}{4}(1-s^2) = \\frac12(1+s)\\frac12(1+s) \\] where \\(s=|\\vec{s}|\\). It follows that the two eigenvalues of \\(\\rho\\) are \\(\\frac12(1\\pm s)\\).

A state such as \\[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\left( |00\\rangle + |11\\rangle \\right) \\] guarantees perfect correlations when each qubit is measured in the standard basis: the two equally likely outcomes are (\\(0\\) and \\(0\\)) or (\\(1\\) and \\(1\\)), but any single qubit outcome, be it \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) or anything else, is completely random. "],["partial-trace-revisited.html", "8.6 Partial trace, revisited", " 8.6 Partial trace, revisited If you are given a matrix you calculate the trace by summing its diagonal entries. How about the partial trace? Suppose someone writes down for you a density matrix of two qubits in the standard basis, \\(\\{|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle\\}\\), and asks you to find the reduced density matrices of the individual qubits. The tensor product structure of this \\((4\\times 4)\\)-matrix means that it is has a block form: \\[ \\rho^{AB} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c|c} P &amp; Q \\\\\\hline R &amp; S \\end{array} \\right] \\] where \\(P,Q,R,S\\) are \\(2\\times 2\\) sized sub-matrices.

Take any of the Bell states, write its \\((4\\times 4)\\)-density matrix explicitly, and then trace over each qubit. In each case you should get the maximally mixed state.↩︎ "],["mixtures-and-subsystems.html", "8.7 Mixtures and subsystems", " 8.7 Mixtures and subsystems We have used the density operators to describe two distinct situations: the statistical properties of the mixtures of states, and the statistical properties of subsystems of composite systems. In order to see the relationship between the two, consider a joint state of a bipartite system \\(\\mathcal{AB}\\), written in a product basis in \\(\\mathcal{H}_A\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_B\\) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} |\\psi_{AB}\\rangle &amp;= \\sum_{ij} c_{ij}|a_i\\rangle\\otimes|b_j\\rangle \\\\&amp;= \\sum_{j=1} |\\widetilde\\psi_j\\rangle|b_j\\rangle \\\\&amp;= \\sum_{j=1} \\sqrt{p_j}|\\psi_j\\rangle|b_j\\rangle \\end{aligned} \\tag{8.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(|\\widetilde\\psi_j\\rangle = \\sum_i c_{ij}|a_i\\rangle = \\sqrt{p_j}|\\psi_j\\rangle\\), and the vectors \\(|\\psi_j\\rangle\\) are the normalised versions of the \\(|\\widetilde\\psi_j\\rangle\\). Note that \\(p_j=\\langle\\widetilde\\psi_j|\\widetilde\\psi_j\\rangle\\). Then the partial trace over \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) gives the reduced density operator of subsystem \\(\\mathcal{A}\\): \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\rho^A =\\operatorname{tr}_B \\sum_{ij} |\\widetilde\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\widetilde\\psi_j| \\otimes |b_i\\rangle\\langle b_j| &amp;= \\sum_{ij} |\\widetilde\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\widetilde\\psi_j| (\\operatorname{tr}|b_i\\rangle\\langle b_j|) \\\\&amp;= \\sum_{ij} |\\widetilde\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\widetilde\\psi_j| \\langle b_j|b_i\\rangle \\\\&amp;= \\sum_{i} |\\widetilde\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\widetilde\\psi_i| = \\sum_{i} p_i |\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i|. \\end{aligned} \\] Now, let us see how \\(\\rho^A\\) can be understood in terms of mixtures. Let us place subsystems \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) in separate labs, run by Alice and Bob, respectively. When Bob measures part \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) in the \\(|b_j\\rangle\\) basis and obtains result \\(k\\), which happens with the probability \\(p_k\\), he prepares subsystem \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) in the state \\(|\\psi_k\\rangle\\): \\[ \\sum_{i=1} \\sqrt{p_j}|\\psi_i\\rangle|b_i\\rangle \\overset{\\mathrm{outcome}\\,k}{\\longmapsto} |\\psi_k\\rangle|b_k\\rangle. \\] Bob does not communicate the outcome of his measurement. Thus, from Alice’s perspective, Bob prepares a mixture of \\(|\\psi_1\\rangle,\\ldots,|\\psi_m\\rangle\\), with probabilities \\(p_1,\\ldots,p_m\\), which means that Alice, who knows the joint state but not the outcomes of Bob’s measurement, may associate density matrix \\(\\rho_A=\\sum_i p_i|\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i|\\) with her subsystem \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). This is the same \\(\\rho^A\\) which we obtained by the partial trace. But suppose Bob chooses to measure his subsystem in some other basis. Will it have any impact on Alice’s statistical predictions? Measurement in the new basis will result in a different mixture, but Alice’s density operator will not change. Suppose Bob chooses basis \\(|d_i\\rangle\\) for his measurement. Any two orthonormal bases are connected by some unitary transformation, and so we can write \\(|b_i\\rangle = U|d_i\\rangle\\) for some unitary \\(U\\). In terms of components, \\(|b_i\\rangle = \\sum_j U_{ij}|d_j\\rangle\\). The joint state can now be expressed as \\[ \\begin{aligned} |\\psi_{AB}\\rangle &amp;= \\sum_{i} |\\widetilde\\psi_i\\rangle|b_i\\rangle \\\\&amp;= \\sum_{i} |\\widetilde\\psi_i\\rangle \\left( \\sum_j U_{ij}|d_j\\rangle \\right) \\\\&amp;= \\sum_j \\underbrace{\\left( \\sum_i U_{ij}|\\widetilde\\psi_i\\rangle \\right)}_{|\\widetilde\\phi_j\\rangle}|d_j\\rangle \\\\&amp;= \\sum_j|\\widetilde\\phi_j\\rangle|d_j\\rangle. \\end{aligned} \\] If Bob measures in the \\(|d_i\\rangle\\) basis then he generates a new mixture of states \\(|\\phi_1\\rangle,\\ldots|\\phi_m\\rangle\\), which are the normalised versions of \\(|\\widetilde\\phi_1\\rangle,\\ldots|\\widetilde\\phi_m\\rangle\\), with each \\(|\\phi_k\\rangle\\) occurring with probability \\(p_k=\\langle\\widetilde\\phi_k\\rangle{\\widetilde\\phi_k}\\). But this new mixture has exactly the same density operator as the previous one:39 \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\sum_j|\\widetilde\\phi_j\\rangle\\langle\\widetilde\\phi_j| &amp;= \\sum_{ijl} U_{ij}|\\widetilde\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\widetilde\\psi_l|U^\\star_{lj} \\\\&amp;= \\sum_{il} \\underbrace{\\left(\\sum_j U_{ij}U^\\star_{lj}\\right)}_{\\delta_{il}}|\\widetilde\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\widetilde\\psi_l| \\\\&amp;= \\sum_i|\\widetilde\\psi_j\\rangle\\langle\\widetilde\\psi_j|, \\end{aligned} \\] which is exactly \\(\\rho_A\\). So does it really matter whether Bob performs the measurement or not? It does not. After all, Alice and Bob may be miles away from each other, and if any of Bob’s actions were to result in something that is physically detectable at the Alice’s location that would amount to instantaneous communication between the two of them. From the operational point of view it does not really matter whether the density operator represents our ignorance of the actual state (mixtures) or provides the only description we can have after discarding one part of an entangled state (partial trace).40 In the former case, the system is in some definite pure state but we do not know which. In contrast, when the density operator arises from tracing out irrelevant, or unavailable, degrees of freedom, the individual system cannot be thought to be in some definite state of which we are ignorant. Philosophy aside, the fact that the two interpretations give exactly the same predictions is useful: switching back and forth between the two pictures often offers additional insights and may even simplify lengthy calculations. The \\(U_{ij}\\) are the components of a unitary matrix, hence \\(\\sum_k U_{ik}U^\\star_{jk}=\\delta_{ij}\\).↩︎ The two interpretations of density operators filled volumes of academic papers. The terms proper mixtures and improper mixtures are used, mostly by philosophers, to describe the statistical mixture and the partial trace approach, respectively.↩︎ "],["partial-trace-yet-again.html", "8.8 Partial trace, yet again", " 8.8 Partial trace, yet again The partial trace is the only map \\(\\rho^{AB}\\mapsto\\rho^A\\) such that41 \\[ \\operatorname{tr}X \\rho^A = \\operatorname{tr}(X\\otimes\\operatorname{id})\\rho^{AB} \\] holds for any observable \\(X\\) acting on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).
