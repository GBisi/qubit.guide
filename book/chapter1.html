<blockquote>
<p>About complex numbers, called probability amplitudes, that, unlike probabilities, can cancel each other out, leading to quantum interference and qualitatively new ways of processing information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The classical theory of computation does not usually refer to physics.
Pioneers such as Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, Emil Post, and Kurt Gödel managed to capture the correct classical theory by intuition alone and, as a result, it is often falsely assumed that its foundations are self-evident and purely abstract.
They are not!<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The concepts of information and computation can be properly formulated only in the context of a physical theory — information is stored, transmitted and processed always by <em>physical</em> means.
Computers are physical objects and computation is a physical process.
Indeed, any computation, classical or quantum, can be viewed in terms of physical experiments, which produce <strong>outputs</strong> that depend on initial preparations called <strong>inputs</strong>.
Once we abandon the classical view of computation as a purely logical notion independent of the laws of physics it becomes clear that whenever we improve our knowledge about physical reality, we may also gain new means of computation.
Thus, from this perspective, it is not very surprising that the discovery of quantum mechanics in particular has changed our understanding of the nature of computation.
In order to explain what makes quantum computers so different from their classical counterparts, we begin with the rudiments of quantum theory.</p>
<p>Some of what we say in this chapter will be repeated in later chapters, but usually in much more detail.
Feel free to think of this chapter as a sort of “aeroplane tour” of the rudiments, knowing that we will soon land on the ground to go out exploring by foot.</p>
<div id="two-basic-rules" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Two basic rules</h2>
<p>Quantum theory, at least at some instrumental level, can be viewed as a modification of probability theory.
We replace positive numbers (probabilities) with complex numbers <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> (called <strong>probability amplitudes</strong>) such that the squares of their absolute values, <span class="math inline">\(|z|^2\)</span>, are interpreted as probabilities.</p>
<div class="idea">
<p>The correspondence between probability amplitude <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and probability <span class="math inline">\(p=|z|^2\)</span> is known as <strong>Born’s Rule</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>The rules for combining amplitudes are very reminiscent of the rules for combining probabilities:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Whenever something can happen in a sequence of independent steps, we multiply the amplitudes of each step.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="288" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Whenever something can happen in several alternative ways, we add the amplitudes for each separate way.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="216" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>That’s it!
These two rules are basically all you need to manipulate amplitudes in any physical process, no matter how complicated.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
They are universal and apply to any physical system, from elementary particles through atoms and molecules to white dwarfs stars.
They also apply to information, since, as we have already emphasised, information is physical.
The two rules look deceptively simple but, as you will see in a moment, their consequences are anything but trivial.</p>
</div>
<div id="quantum-interference-the-failure-of-probability-theory" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Quantum interference: the failure of probability theory</h2>
<p>Modern mathematical probability theory is based on three axioms, proposed by Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov (1903–1987) in his monograph with the impressive German title <em>Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung</em> (“Foundations of Probability Theory”).
The <strong>Kolmogorov axioms</strong> are simple and intuitive:<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Once you identify all elementary outcomes, or events, you may then assign probabilities to them.</li>
<li>Probability is a number between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and an event which is certain has probability <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the probability of any event can be calculated using a deceptively simple rule — the <strong>additivity axiom</strong>:
<em>Whenever an event can occur in several mutually exclusive ways, the probability for the event is the sum of the probabilities for each way considered separately.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Obvious, isn’t it?
So obvious, in fact, that probability theory was accepted as a mathematical framework theory, a language that can be used to describe actual physical phenomena.
Physics should be able to identify elementary events and assign numerical probabilities to them.
Once this is done we may revert to mathematical formalism of probability theory.
The Kolmogorov axioms will take care of the mathematical consistency and will guide us whenever there is a need to calculate probabilities of more complex events.
This is a very sensible approach, apart from the fact that it does not always work!
Today, we know that probability theory, as ubiquitous as it is, fails to describe many common quantum phenomena.
In order to see the need for quantum theory let us consider a simple experiment in which probability theory fails to give the right predictions.</p>
<div id="the-double-slit-experiment" class="section level3" number="1.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> The double slit experiment</h3>
<p>In a double slit experiment, a particle emitted from a source <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> can reach the detector <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> by taking two different paths, e.g. through an upper or a lower slit in a barrier between the source and the detector.
After sufficiently many repetitions of this experiment we can evaluate the frequency of clicks in the detector <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and show that it is inconsistent with the predictions based on probability theory.
Let us use the quantum approach to show how the discrepancy arises.</p>
<p>The particle emitted from a source <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> can reach detector <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> by taking two different paths, with amplitudes <span class="math inline">\(z_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_2\)</span> respectively.
We may say that the upper slit is taken with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_1=|z_1|^2\)</span> and the lower slit with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_2=|z_2|^2\)</span>.
These are two mutually exclusive events.
With the two slits open, probability theory declares (by the additivity axiom) that the particle should reach the detector with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_1+p_2= |z_1|^2+|z_2|^2\)</span>.
But this is not what happens experimentally!</p>
<p>Following the “quantum rules”, first we add the amplitudes and then we square the absolute value of the sum to get the probability.
Thus, the particle will reach the detector with probability
<span class="math display" id="eq:interference">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  p &amp;= |z|^2
\\&amp; = |z_1 + z_2|^2
\\&amp; = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2
      + z_1^\star z_2 + z_1 z_2^\star
\\&amp; = p_1 + p_2
      + |z_1||z_2|\left(
        e^{i(\varphi_2-\varphi_1)}
        + e^{-i(\varphi_2-\varphi_1)}
      \right)
\\&amp; = p_1 + p_2
      + 2 \sqrt{p_1 p_2} \cos(\varphi_2-\varphi_1)
\\&amp; = p_1 + p_2 + \mbox{interference terms}
\end{aligned}
\tag{1.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where we have expressed the amplitudes in their polar forms
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  z_1 &amp;= |z_1|e^{i\varphi_1}
\\z_2 &amp;= |z_2|e^{i\varphi_2}.
\end{aligned}
\]</span>
The appearance of the interference terms marks the departure from the classical theory of probability.
The probability of any two seemingly mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities of the individual events, <span class="math inline">\(p_1 + p_2\)</span>, <em>modified</em> by the <strong>interference term</strong> <span class="math inline">\(2 \sqrt{p_1p_2}\cos(\varphi_2-\varphi_1)\)</span>.
Depending on the <strong>relative phase</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_2-\varphi_1\)</span>, the interference term can be either negative (which we call <strong>destructive</strong> interference) or positive (<strong>constructive</strong> interference), leading to either suppression or enhancement of the total probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>The algebra is simple; our focus is on the physical interpretation.
Firstly, note that the important quantity here is the <em>relative</em> phase <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_2-\varphi_1\)</span> rather than the individual values <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_2\)</span>.
This observation is not trivial at all.
If a particle reacts only to the difference of the two phases, each pertaining to a separate path, then it must have, somehow, experienced the two paths, right?
Thus we cannot say that the particle has travelled either through the upper or the lower slit, because it has travelled through <em>both</em>.
In the same way, quantum computers follow, in some tangible way, all computational paths simultaneously, producing answers that depend on all these alternative calculations.
Weird, but this is how it is!
Secondly, what has happened to the additivity axiom in probability theory — what is wrong with it?
One thing that is wrong is the assumption that the processes of taking the upper or the lower slit are mutually exclusive.
In reality, as we have just mentioned, the two transitions <em>both occur</em>, simultaneously.
However, we cannot learn this from probability theory, or any other a priori mathematical construct.
There is no fundamental reason why Nature should conform to the additivity axiom.
<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
We find out how nature works by making intelligent guesses, running experiments, checking what happens and formulating physical theories.
If our guess disagrees with experiments then it is wrong, so we try another intelligent guess, and another, etc.
Right now, quantum theory is the best guess we have: it offers good explanations and predictions that have not been falsified by any of the existing experiments.
This said, be assured that one day quantum theory will be falsified and we will have to start guessing again.</p>

</div>
<div id="superpositions" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Superpositions</h2>
<p>Amplitudes are more than just tools for calculating probabilities: they tell us something about physical reality.
When we deal with probabilities, we may think about them as numbers that quantify our lack of knowledge.
Indeed, when we say that a particle goes through the upper or the lower slit with some respective probabilities it does go through one of the two slits, we just do not know which one.
In contrast, according to quantum theory, a particle that goes through the upper and the lower slit with certain amplitudes does explore both of the two paths, not just one of them.
This is a statement about a real physical situation, about something that is out there and something we can experiment with.
The assumption that the particle goes through one of the two slits, but we do not know which one, is inconsistent with the experimental observations.
We have to accept that apart from some easy to visualise states, also known as the basis states, such as the particle at the upper slit or the particle at the lower slit, there are infinitely many other states, all of them equally real, in which the particle is in a <em>superposition</em> of the two basis states.
This rather bizarre picture of reality is the best we have at the moment, and it works, at least for now. Physicists write such states as
<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
<span class="math display">\[
|\psi\rangle=\alpha |\text{at the upper slit}\rangle +\beta |\text{at the lower slit}\rangle,
\]</span>
meaning the particle at the upper slit with amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and at the lower slit with amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. Mathematically, you can think about this expression as a vector <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> in a two-dimensional complex vector space written in terms of the two basis vectors <span class="math inline">\(|\text{at the upper slit}\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\text{at the lower slit}\rangle\)</span>. You can also write this vector as a column vector with two complex entries <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, but then you have to explain the physical meaning of the basis states. Here, we use the <span class="math inline">\(|\cdot\rangle\)</span> notation, introduced by Paul Dirac in the early days of the quantum theory as a useful way to write and manipulate vectors. In Dirac notation you can put into the box <span class="math inline">\(|\phantom{0}\rangle\)</span> anything that serves to specify what the vector is. It could be <span class="math inline">\(|\uparrow\rangle\)</span> for spin up and <span class="math inline">\(|\downarrow\rangle\)</span> for spin down, or <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> for a quantum bit holding logical <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> for a quantum bit holding logical <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, etc. As we shall see soon, there is much more to this notation.</p>

<div id="interferometers" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Interferometers</h2>
<p>Many modern interference experiments are performed using internal degrees of freedom of atoms and ions. For example, <strong>Ramsey interferometry</strong>, named after American physicist Norman Ramsey, is a generic name for an interference experiment in which atoms are sent through two separate resonant interaction zones, known as <strong>Ramsey zones</strong>, separated by an intermediate dispersive interaction zone.</p>
<p>Many beautiful experiments of this type were carried out in the 1990s in Serge Haroche’s lab at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. Rubidium atoms were sent through two separate interaction zones (resonant interaction in the first and the third cavity) separated by a phase inducing dispersive interaction zone (the central cavity). The atoms were subsequently measured, via a selective ionisation, and found to be in one of the two preselected energy states, here labeled as <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>. The fraction of atoms found in states <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> showed a clear dependence on the phase shifts induced by the dispersive interaction in the central cavity. In 2012 Serge Haroche and Dave Wineland shared the Nobel Prize in physics for “ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems.”</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The three rectangular boxes in Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:ramsey-figure">1.1</a> represent three cavities, each cavity being an arrangement of mirrors which traps electromagnetic field (think about standing waves in between two mirrors).
The oval shapes represent rubidium atoms with two preselected energy states labelled as <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>.
Each atom is initially prepared in a highly excited internal energy state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and zips through the three cavities, from the left to the right.
In each cavity the atom interacts with the cavity field.
The first and the third cavities are, for all theoretical purposes, identical.
Their frequencies are tuned to the resonant frequency of the atom, and the atom exchanges energy with the cavity, going back and forth between its energy states <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>.
In contrast, in the second (central) cavity, the atom undergoes the so-called dispersive interaction: it is too off resonance to exchange energy with the field but its energy states “feel” the field and acquire phase shifts.
After experiencing this well timed sequence of resonant–dispersive–resonant interactions, the energy of the atom is measured and the atom is found to be either in state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> or state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>.
The fraction of atoms that is found in state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> shows a clear dependence on the phase shifts induced by the dispersive interaction in the central cavity.</p>
<p>We can understand this interference better if we follow the two internal states of the atom as it moves through the three cavities.</p>

<p>Suppose we are interested in the probability that the atom, initially in state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span>, will be found, after completing its journey through the three cavities, in state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>.
As you can see in Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:ramsey-figure-2">1.2</a>, this can happen in two ways, as indicated by the two red paths connecting the input state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> on the left with the output state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> on the right.
Again, let <span class="math inline">\(U_{ij}\)</span> denote the probability amplitude that input <span class="math inline">\(|j\rangle\)</span> generates output <span class="math inline">\(|i\rangle\)</span> (for <span class="math inline">\(i,j=0,1\)</span>).
We can see from the diagram that
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    U_{10}
    &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt2} e^{i\varphi_0}\frac{1}{\sqrt2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt2} e^{i\varphi_1}\frac{-1}{\sqrt2}
  \\&amp;= \frac12 e^{i\varphi_0} - \frac12 e^{i\varphi_1}
  \\&amp;= -ie^{i\varphi/2}\sin\frac{\varphi}{2},
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\varphi = \varphi_0-\varphi_1\)</span> is the relative phase.
The corresponding probability reads<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    P_{10}
    &amp;= \vert U_{10}\vert^2

  \\&amp;= \frac12 - \frac12\cos\varphi.

\]</span>
You should recognise the first term, <span class="math inline">\(\frac12\)</span>, as the “classical” probability and the second one, <span class="math inline">\(-\frac12\cos\varphi\)</span>, as the interference term.
We can repeat such calculations for any other pair of input–output states.
This approach works fine here but, in general, tracking all possible paths in evolving quantum systems can become messy when the number of input and output states increases.
There is, however, a neat way of doing it via matrix multiplication.</p>
<p>The effect of each interaction on atomic states can be described by a matrix of transition amplitudes, as illustrated in Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:interference-matrix">1.3</a>.
Then a sequence of independent interactions is described by the product of these matrices.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Quantum decoherence</h2>
<p>We do need quantum theory to describe many physical phenomena, but, at the same time, there are many other phenomena where the classical theory of probability works pretty well.
We hardly see quantum interference on a daily basis.
Why?
The answer is <strong>decoherence</strong>.
The addition of probability amplitudes, rather than probabilities, applies to physical systems which are completely isolated.
However, it is almost impossible to isolate a complex quantum system, such as a quantum computer, from the rest of the world.
There will always be spurious interactions with the environment, and when we add amplitudes, we have to take into account not only different configurations of the physical system at hand, but also different configurations of the environment.</p>
<p>For example, consider an isolated system composed of a quantum computer and its environment.
The computer is prepared in some input state <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and generates output <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>.
Let us look at the following two scenarios:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>The computer is isolated and quantum computation does not affect the environment.</em>
The computer and the environment evolve independently from each other and, as a result, the environment does not hold any physical record of how the computer reached output <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>.
In this case we add the amplitudes for each of the two alternative computational paths.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="144" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Quantum computation affects the environment.</em>
The environment now holds a physical record of how the computer reached output <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, which results in two final states of the composed system (computer + environment) which we denote <span class="math inline">\(O_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(O_2\)</span>.
We add the probabilities for each of the two alternative computational paths.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="144" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>When quantum computation affects the environment, we have to include the environment in our analysis for it now takes part in the computation.
Depending on which computational path was taken, the environment may end up in two distinct states.
The computer itself may show output <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, but when we include the environment we have not one, but two outputs, <span class="math inline">\(O_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(O_2\)</span>, denoting, respectively, “computer shows output <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> and the environment knows that path <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> was taken” and “computer shows output <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> and the environment knows that path <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> was taken”.
There are no alternative ways of reaching <span class="math inline">\(O_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(O_2\)</span>, hence there is no interference, and the corresponding probabilities read <span class="math inline">\(p_1=|z_1|^2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(O_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p_2=|z_2|^2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(O_2\)</span>.
The probability that the computer shows output <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, regardless the state of the environment, is the sum of of the two probabilities: <span class="math inline">\(p=p_1+p_2\)</span>.
We have lost the interference term and any advantages of quantum computation along with it.
In the presence of decoherence the interference formula <a href="chapter1.html#eq:interference">(1.1)</a> is modified and reads
<span class="math display">\[
p
= p_1 + p_2 + 2 v \sqrt{p_1 p_2}\cos (\varphi_2-\varphi_1),
\]</span>
where the parameter <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, called the <strong>visibility</strong> of the interference pattern, ranges from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> (the environment can perfectly distinguish between the two paths, total decoherence, no interference) to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (the environment cannot distinguish between the two paths, no decoherence, full interference), with the values in between corresponding to partial decoherence.</p>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="384" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We shall derive this formula later on, and you will see that <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> quantifies the degree of distinguishability between <span class="math inline">\(O_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(O_2\)</span>.
The more the environment knows about which path was taken the less interference we see.</p>
<div class="idea">
<p>Decoherence suppresses quantum interference.</p>
</div>
<p>Decoherence is chiefly responsible for our classical description of the world — without interference terms we may as well add probabilities instead of amplitudes.
While decoherence is a serious impediment to building quantum computers, depriving us of the power of quantum interference, it is not all doom and gloom: there are clever ways around decoherence, such as quantum error correction and fault-tolerant methods we will meet later.</p>

Now, let the qubits interact in a controllable fashion.
We are computing.
Think about computation as a physical process that evolves a prescribed initial configuration of a computing machine, called <strong><span class="math inline">\(\texttt{INPUT}\)</span></strong>, into some final configuration, called <strong><span class="math inline">\(\texttt{OUTPUT}\)</span></strong>.
We shall refer to the configurations as <strong>states</strong>.

</div>
<p>That computation was <strong>deterministic</strong>: every time you run it with the same input, you get the same output.
But a computation does not have to be deterministic — we can augment a computing machine by allowing it to “toss an unbiased coin” and to choose its steps randomly.
It can then be viewed as a directed<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> tree-like graph where each node corresponds to a state of the machine, and each edge represents one step of the computation, as shown in Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:probabilistic-computation">1.5</a></p>

<p>The computation starts from some initial state (<span class="math inline">\(\texttt{INPUT}\)</span>) and it subsequently branches into other nodes representing states reachable with non-zero probability from the initial state.
The probability of a particular final state (<span class="math inline">\(\texttt{OUTPUT}\)</span>) being reached is equal to the sum of the probabilities along all mutually exclusive paths which connect the initial state with that particular state.
Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:probabilistic-computation">1.5</a> shows only two computational paths, but, in general, there could be many more paths (here, up to 256) contributing to the final probability.
Quantum computation can be represented by a similar graph, as in <a href="chapter1.html#fig:quantum-computation">1.6</a>.</p>

<p>For quantum computations, we associate with each edge in the graph the probability <em>amplitude</em> that the computation follows that edge.
The probability amplitude of a particular path to be followed is the product of amplitudes pertaining to transitions in each step.
The probability amplitude of a particular final state being reached is equal to the sum of the amplitudes along all mutually exclusive paths which connect the initial state with that particular state:
<span class="math display">\[

<p>Is there a compelling reason why we should care about quantum computation?
It may sound like an extravagant way to compute something that can be computed anyway.
Indeed, your standard laptop, given enough time and memory, can simulate pretty much any physical process.
In principle, it can also simulate any quantum interference and compute everything that quantum computers can compute.
The snag is, this simulation, in general, is very inefficient.
And efficiency does matter, especially if you have to wait more than the age of the Universe for your laptop to stop and deliver an answer!<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In order to solve a particular problem, computers (classical or quantum) follow a precise set of instructions called an <strong>algorithm</strong>.
Computer scientists quantify the efficiency of an algorithm according to how rapidly its running time, or the use of memory, increases when it is given ever larger inputs to work on.
An algorithm is said to be <strong>efficient</strong> if the number of elementary operations taken to execute it increases no faster than a polynomial function of the size of the input.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>
We take the input size to be the total number of binary digits (bits) needed to specify the input.
For example, using the algorithm taught in elementary school, one can multiply two <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> digit numbers in a time that grows like the number of digits squared, <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span>.
In contrast, the fastest-known method for the reverse operation — factoring an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-digit integer into prime numbers — takes a time that grows exponentially, roughly as <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span>.
That is considered inefficient.</p>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="384" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The class of problems that can be solved by a deterministic computer in polynomial time is represented by the capital letter <code>P</code>, for <em>polynomial</em> time.
The class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a probabilistic computer is called <code>BPP</code>, for <em>bounded-error probabilistic polynomial</em> time.
It is clear that <code>BPP</code> contains <code>P</code>, since a deterministic computation is a special case of a probabilistic computation in which we never consult the source of randomness.
When we run a probabilistic (a.k.a. randomised) computation many times on the same input, we will not get the same answer every time, but the computation is useful if the probability of getting the right answer is high enough.
Finally, the complexity class <code>BQP</code>, for <em>bounded-error quantum polynomial</em>, is the class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a quantum computer.</p>
<p><img src="quantum-info_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="192" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Since a quantum computer can easily generate random bits and simulate a probabilistic classical computer, <code>BQP</code> certainly contains the class <code>BPP</code>.
Here we are interested in problems that are in <code>BQP</code> but not known to be in <code>BPP</code>.
The most popular example of such a problem is factoring.</p>
<p>A quantum algorithm, discovered by Peter Shor in 1994, can factor <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-digit numbers in a number of steps that grows only as <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span>, as opposed to the <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> that we have classically.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>
Since the intractability of factorisation underpins the security of many methods of encryption, Shor’s algorithm was soon hailed as the first `killer application’ for quantum computation: something very useful that only a quantum computer could do.
Since then, the hunt has been on for interesting things for quantum computers to do, and at the same time, for the scientific and technological advances that could allow us to build quantum computers.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Outlook</h2>
<p>When the physics of computation was first investigated, starting in the 1960s, one of the main motivations was a fear that quantum-mechanical effects might place fundamental bounds on the accuracy with which physical objects could render the properties of the abstract entities, such as logical variables and operations, that appear in the theory of computation.
It turned out, however, that quantum mechanics itself imposes no significant limits, but does break through some of those that classical physics imposed.
The quantum world has a richness and intricacy that allows new practical technologies, and new kinds of knowledge.
In this course we will merely scratch the surface of the rapidly developing field of quantum computation.
We will concentrate mostly on the fundamental issues and skip many experimental details.
However, it should be mentioned that quantum computing is a serious possibility for future generations of computing devices.
At present it is not clear how and when fully-fledged quantum computers will eventually be built;
but this notwithstanding, the quantum theory of computation already plays a much more fundamental role in the scheme of things than its classical predecessor did.
I believe that anyone who seeks a fundamental understanding of either physics, computation or logic must incorporate its new insights into their world view.</p>

<p>Back in 1926, Max Born simply postulated the connection between amplitudes and probabilities.
However, it is worth pointing out that he did not get it quite right on his first approach.
In the original paper<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> proposing the probability interpretation of the state vector (wavefunction) he wrote:</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(^*\)</span> Addition in proof: More careful considerations show that the probability is proportional to the square of the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_{\eta,\tau,m}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)\)</span>.</p>

<p>Suppose that we modified the Born rule, so that probabilities were given by the absolute values of amplitudes raised to power <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> not necessarily equal to <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>).
Then admissible physical evolutions must preserve the normalisation of probability.
Mathematically speaking, they must be isometries of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-norms.</p>
<p>Recall that the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-norm of vector <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, with components <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2,\ldots, v_n\)</span>, is defined as
<span class="math display">\[
  \sqrt[\leftroot{1}\uproot{3}p]{|v_1|^p + |v_2|^p + \ldots + |v_n|^p}.
\]</span>
It is clear that any permutation of vector components and multiplication by phase factors (i.e. unit complex numbers) will leave any <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-norm unchanged.
It turns out that these complex permutations are the <em>only</em> isometries, except for <em>one</em> special case!
For <span class="math inline">\(p=2\)</span>, the isometries are unitary operations, which form a continuous group; in all other cases we are restricted to discrete permutations.
We do not have to go into details of the proof since we can <em>see</em> this result.</p>

As we can see in Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:p-norm-unit-spheres">1.7</a>, the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-norm is special because of its rotational invariance — the probability measure picks out no preferred basis in the space of state vectors.
Moreover, it respects unitary operations and does not restrict them in any way.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.10.6</span> Physics against logic?</h3>
<p>Now that we have poked our heads into the quantum world, let us see how quantum interference challenges conventional logic and leads to qualitatively different computations.
Consider the following task (which we will return to a few more times in later chapters): design a logic gate that operates on a single bit such that, when it is followed by another, identical, logic gate, the output is <em>always</em> the negation of the input.
Let us call this logic gate <strong>the square root of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{NOT}\)</span></strong>, or <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\texttt{NOT}}\)</span>.
A simple check, such as an attempt to construct a truth table, should persuade you that there is no such operation in logic.
It may seem reasonable to argue that since there is no such operation in logic, <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\texttt{NOT}}\)</span> is impossible.
Think again!</p>
<p>Figure <a href="chapter1.html#fig:sqrt-not">1.9</a> shows a simple computation, two identical computational steps performed on two states labelled as <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, i.e. on one bit.
An interplay of constructive and destructive interference makes some transitions impossible and the result is the logical <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{NOT}\)</span>.
Thus, quantum theory declares, the square root of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{NOT}\)</span> is possible.
And it does exist!
Experimental physicists routinely construct this and many other “impossible” gates in their laboratories.
They are the building blocks of a quantum computer.
Quantum theory explains the behaviour of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\texttt{NOT}}\)</span>, hence, reassured by the physical experiments that corroborate this theory, logicians are now entitled to propose a new logical operation <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\texttt{NOT}}\)</span>.
Why?
Because a faithful physical model for it exists in nature.</p>
<p>Write a <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> matrix which describes the <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\texttt{NOT}}\)</span> operation.
Is there just one such a matrix?

<p>The classical theory of computation is essentially the theory of the universal Turing machine — the most popular mathematical model of classical computation.
Its significance relies on the fact that, given a large but finite amount of time, the universal Turing machine is capable of any computation that can be done by any modern classical digital computer, no matter how powerful.
The concept of Turing machines may be modified to incorporate quantum computation, but we will not follow this path.
It is much easier to explain the essence of quantum computation talking about quantum logic gates and quantum Boolean networks or circuits.
The two approaches are computationally equivalent, even though certain theoretical concepts, e.g. in computational complexity, are easier to formulate precisely using the Turing machine model.
The main advantage of quantum circuits is that they relate far more directly to proposed experimental realisations of quantum computation.</p>

<p>In computational complexity the basic distinction is between polynomial and exponential algorithms.
Polynomial growth is good and exponential growth is bad, especially if you have to pay for it.
There is an old story about the legendary inventor of chess who asked the Persian king to be paid only by a grain of cereal, doubled on each of the 64 squares of a chess board.
The king placed one grain of rice on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and he was supposed to keep on doubling until the board was full.
The last square would then have <span class="math inline">\(2^{63}=9,223,372,036,854,775,808\)</span> grains of rice, more than has been ever harvested on planet Earth, to which we must add the grains of all previous squares, making the total number about twice as large.
If we placed that many grains in an unbroken line we would reach the nearest star Alpha Centauri, our closest celestial neighbour beyond the solar system, about <span class="math inline">\(4.4\)</span> light-years away.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>
The moral of the story: if whatever you do requires an exponential use of resources, you are in trouble.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.10.11</span> </h3>
<p>In order to make qualitative distinctions between how different functions grow we will often use the asymptotic big-<span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> notation.
For example, suppose an algorithm running on input of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> takes <span class="math inline">\(a n^2+bn+c\)</span> elementary steps, for some positive constants <span class="math inline">\(a, b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.
These constants depend mainly on the details of the implementation and the choice of elementary steps.
What we really care about is that, for large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the whole expression is dominated by its quadratic term.
We then say that the running time of this algorithm grows as <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span>, and we write it as <span class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span>, ignoring the less significant terms and the constant coefficients.
More precisely, let <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(n)\)</span> be functions from positive integers to positive reals.
You may think of <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(n)\)</span> as the running times of two algorithms on inputs of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.
We say <span class="math inline">\(f=O(g)\)</span>,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> which means that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> grows no faster than <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, if there is a constant <span class="math inline">\(c&gt;0\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\leqslant c g(n)\)</span> for all sufficiently large values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.
Essentially, <span class="math inline">\(f=O(g)\)</span> is a very loose analogue of <span class="math inline">\(f \leqslant g\)</span>.
In addition to the big-<span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> notation, computer scientists often use <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> for lower bounds: <span class="math inline">\(f=\Omega (g)\)</span> means <span class="math inline">\(g=O(f)\)</span>.
Again, this is a very loose analogue of <span class="math inline">\(f \geqslant g\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When we say that <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=O(\log n)\)</span>, why don’t we have to specify the base of the logarithm?</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=5n^3+1000n+50\)</span>. Is <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=O(n^3)\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(O(n^4)\)</span>, or both?</p></li>
