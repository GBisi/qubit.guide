We have already seen the (single-qubit) Pauli matrices, along with a brief look into their algebraic structure, in Section \@ref(pauli-matrices-algebraically).

$$
  \id = \begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}
  \qquad
  X = \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}
  \qquad
  Y = \begin{bmatrix}0&-i\\i&0\end{bmatrix}
  \qquad
  Z = \begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&-1\end{bmatrix}
$$

Recall that these matrices span the entire space of $(2\times2)$ complex matrices, square to the identity (and thus can only have eigenvalues in the set $\{+1,-1\}$), and are both Hermitian and unitary.
As such, they can represent both observables *and* unitary evolutions.
Any two given Pauli matrices either commute or anticommute.

As one final reminder, we often refer to the Pauli matrices as "matrices", but they are defined as operators by the commutations relations, without reference to any particular basis.
That is, the Pauli operators $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are defined exactly by the relations
$$
  \begin{gathered}
    X^2 = Y^2 = Z^2 = \id
  \\XY=iZ \qquad YZ=iX \qquad ZX=iY
  \\YX=-iZ \qquad ZY=-iX \qquad XZ=-iY.
  \end{gathered}
$$


## Pauli and his group

When we multiply the four Pauli matrices with one another we get Pauli matrices in return, but with possible phase factors $\pm1$ and $\pm i$ (e.g. $XY=iZ$).
Once we include these phase factors, ensuring that we have a set that is closed under matrix multiplication, we obtain the **single qubit Pauli group**, which we denote by $\mathcal{P}_1$.

In order to characterise a group, we can simply list all its elements and define the group operation on each possible pair, but it is usually more efficient to use the notion of **group generators**.^[Note how similar this is to the definition of a basis for a vector space.]
Given a group $G$, these are elements $g_1,\ldots,g_n$ of the group that are **independent** (we cannot write any one of them as a product of some of the others) and such that every element of $G$ can be written as a product of (possibly repeated) elements of $\{g_1,\ldots,g_n\}$.
If $G$ is generated by $g_1,\ldots,g_n$, then we write $G=\langle g_1,\ldots,g_n\rangle$.

The **single-qubit Pauli group** $\mathcal{P}_1$ is defined by
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{P}_1
    &\coloneqq \langle X,Y,Z\rangle
  \\&= \{\pm\id, \pm i\id, \pm X, \pm iX, \pm Y, \pm iY, \pm Z, \pm iZ\}.
  \end{aligned}
$$

The **$n$-qubit Pauli group** $\mathcal{P}_n$ is defined to consist of all $n$-fold tensor products of Pauli matrices, with possible global phase factors $\pm1$ and $\pm i$, i.e.
$$
  \mathcal{P}_n
  \coloneqq \{P_1\otimes\ldots\otimes P_n \mid P_1,\ldots,P_n\in\mathcal{P}_1\}.
$$
This group has $4^{n+1}$ elements: $4\times4^n$, since we have to account for the possible global phase factors (which usually aren't very important for practical applications, but are necessary in order to have a well defined group).^[As a small mathematical aside, we could use some group theory here: $\mathcal{P}_n$ has two trivial (multiplicative) subgroups, namely $Z_2=\{\pm1\}$ and $Z_4=\{\pm1,\pm i\}$; the quotient group $\mathcal{P}_n/Z_4$ is exactly the $n$-qubit Pauli group but with the phases ignored.]
:::

Some researchers prefer to think of the (single-qubit) Pauli group as the group generated only by $X$ and $Z$ (leaving out $Y$), which then only has 8 elements: $\pm1$, $\pm X$, $\pm Z$, and $\pm iY$.
We do **not** follow this convention.

::: {.technical title="Central products" latex=""}
One abstract way of defining the Pauli group, without having to make any reference to matrices (and thus to bases), or even to operators, is using the notion of a [**central product**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_product).
This is a way of combining two smaller group into one large group, but "respecting" the commutative parts of each, which means that it arises as a quotient of the [**direct product**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_product_of_groups) (which is somehow the most blunt way of combining together two groups).

The **cyclic group of order 4** is the abstract manifestation of something maybe more familiar: the additive group of integers modulo 4.
That is, the numbers $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ form a group under addition, but where we take the addition to be "remainder 4", so that e.g. $3+2=1$.
In abstract algebra, this group is denoted by $C_4$.

The **dihedral group of order 8** (sometimes, very confusingly, also referred to as being of order *4*) arises as the symmetry group of a square: we can rotate a square by $90^\circ$, or reflect it along either of the axis joining any two diagonally opposite corners, or reflect it along either of the axis joining the midpoints of any two opposite sides --- doing any of these actions leaves the square looking exactly how it started.
But some of these actions describe the same thing!
For example, reflecting through the vertical axis and then the horizontal axis is the same as rotating by $180^\circ$ (try visualising this by flipping and rotating your hand!), which is a specific example of the more general fact (which we briefly touched upon in Section @\ref(composition-of-rotations)) that the composition of two reflections is the same as a rotation through twice the angle between the two axes.
In abstract algebra, this group is denoted by $D_8$ (though in geometry it is often written as $D_4$ instead).

The relevance to the Pauli group is this: the central product of $C_4$ and $D_8$ is exactly $\mathcal{P}_1$.
:::

If it is clear that we are working with *tensor products* of Pauli matrices, then we often (as per usual) omit the tensor product symbol, writing e.g. $XY\id Z$ instead of $X\otimes Y\otimes\id\otimes Z$ when talking about $\mathcal{P}_4$.
Note however that we only do this when it is obvious what we mean: this is very different from the product $XY\id Z=i\id$ inside $\mathcal{P}_1$!

Let's now talk a little bit about the algebraic structure of $\mathcal{P}_n$.
Multiplying together elements is fairly simple: since they are tensor products, we multiply them component-wise, but just remembering to pay attention to the global phase.
For example, we can multiply $ZXX\id$ and $XXYY$ in $\mathcal{P}_4$ as follows:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (ZXX\id)\cdot(XXYY)
    &= (ZX)(XX)(XY)(\id Y)
  \\&= (iY)(\id)(iZ)(Y)
  \\&= -Y\id ZY.
  \end{aligned}
$$
Any pair of elements in $\mathcal{P}_n$ either commute or anticommute: given $P=P_1\ldots P_n$ and $Q=Q_1\ldots Q_n$, we notice that they commute exactly whenever the number of *anticommuting* components (indices $j$ such that $P_jQ_j=-Q_jP_j$) is even, since then the minus signs cancel out.
In other words, $PQ=(-1)^J QP$, where $J=|\{j\text{ such that }P_jQ_j=-Q_jP_j\}|$.
