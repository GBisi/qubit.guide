> About the structure of the **Pauli group**, which is the group generated by tensor products of the Pauli matrices, including the identity.
> It has nice algebraic properties which are useful in many areas of quantum information science, in particular quantum error correction and classical simulations of some types of quantum computation.
> We will discuss how certain subgroups of the Pauli group, and in particular stabilisers and normalisers of these subgroups, slice the Pauli group into interesting cosets that have a group structure of their own.
> We will also look at the **Clifford group**, which is a set of unitary operators that preserve the Pauli group under conjugation and describes the easy part of quantum computation.

We have already seen the (single-qubit) Pauli matrices, along with a brief look into their algebraic structure, in Chapter \@ref(pauli-matrices-algebraically).

Recall that these matrices span the entire space of $(2\times2)$ complex matrices, square to the identity (and thus can only have eigenvalues in the set $\{+1,-1\}$), and are both Hermitian and unitary.
As such, they can represent both observables *and* unitary evolutions.
Any two given Pauli matrices either commute or anticommute.
