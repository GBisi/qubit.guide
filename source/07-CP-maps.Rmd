# Quantum channels, or CP maps {#chapter7}

> Quantum evolution of any *isolated* system is unitary but its constituent parts may evolve in a more complicated way. In this chapter we will go beyond unitary evolutions and describe physically realisable transformations of density operators, called quantum channels. Be prepared for some name dropping; you will hear about Karl Kraus, Woody Stinespring, Andrzej Jamiołkowski and Man-Duen Choi. To be sure, knowing names will not give you more insights, but at least you will not be intimidated when you hear about the **Stinespring** and the **Kraus representations**, the **Jamiołkowski isomorphism**, or the **Choi matrix**.

We discussed how entanglement forced us to describe quantum states of open quantum systems (ones which are part of a larger system) in terms of density operators.
In this chapter we will describe how open systems evolve.
The question we are asking here is: what are the most general physically admissible transformations of density operators?
At the fundamental level --- and this should be your quantum mantra^[...there is only one unitary evolution, there is only one unitary evolution, there only one unitary evolution... ...and everything else is cheating] --- there is *only one* unitary evolution, and if there is any other evolution then it has to be derived from a unitary evolution.
From this perspective, any non-unitary evolution of an open system is induced by a unitary evolution of a larger system.
But how?
The short answer is: by adding (tensoring) and removing (partial trace) physical systems.
A typical combination of these operations is shown in the following diagram:

```{r,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="tikz2pdf.tex"),fig.width=3}
\begin{quantikz}
  \lstick{fixed state $\ket{a}$}
  & \gate[wires=2]{U}
  & \rstick{discard} \qw
\\\lstick{input $\rho$}
  &
  & \rstick{$\rho'$ output } \qw
\end{quantikz}
```
