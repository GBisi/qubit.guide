# Quantum channels, or CP maps {#chapter7}

> Quantum evolution of any *isolated* system is unitary but its constituent parts may evolve in a more complicated way. In this chapter we will go beyond unitary evolutions and describe physically realisable transformations of density operators, called quantum channels. Be prepared for some name dropping; you will hear about Karl Kraus, Woody Stinespring, Andrzej Jamiołkowski and Man-Duen Choi. To be sure, knowing names will not give you more insights, but at least you will not be intimidated when you hear about the **Stinespring** and the **Kraus representations**, the **Jamiołkowski isomorphism**, or the **Choi matrix**.
