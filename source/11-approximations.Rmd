> About **TO-DO**

We have talked a lot about preparing specific quantum states and constructing specific unitary operations, but the space of states of any quantum system is a continuous space, and the set of unitary transformations is also continuous.
It is entirely unrealistic to imagine that in the actual world we will be able to prepare, for example, a qubit *precisely* in the state $\ket{0}$, or to perform a unitary transformation that is *exactly* equal to the controlled-not gate.
*We never have infinite precision in our manipulations of the physical world.*
The good news is that, for all practical purposes, infinite precision is not actually necessary, and we can achieve most of our goals by preparing quantum states and performing quantum operations that are "close enough" to the desired ones.
But what is "close enough", and how do we quantify it?


## Metrics

We will start with the second question: how do we quantify this notion of "close enough"?
The central concept is one with which you are probably already somewhat familiar (we mentioned it in \@ref(bras-and-kets) and \@ref(geometry)), namely that of a **metric**, or **distance**.

::: {.idea latex=""}
Given a set $X$, a **metric** (or **distance**) on $X$ is a function $d\colon X\times X\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ such that

- **Identity of indiscernibles:** $d(a,b)=0$ if and only if $a=b$
- **Symmetry:** $d(a,b)=d(b,a)$ for any $a,b\in X$
- **Triangle inequality:** $d(a,c)\leq d(a,b)+d(b,c)$.

**TO-DO** talk about pseudometrics, quasimetrics (nice real life examples), and semimetrics (and maybe extended metrics)

The most common norm is the **Euclidean distance**, that is, distance between two points in Euclidean space.
Given points $A=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)$ and $B=(b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, their Euclidean distance is
$$
 \sqrt{|b_1-a_1|^2 + |b_2-a_2|^2+\ldots +|b_n-a_n|^2}
$$
But we already know that Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ is more than just a set: it is a vector space.
This means that we don't just have a metric space (i.e. a set with a metric), but instead a **normed vector space**, where the **norm** $\|\cdot\|$ of a vector is defined to be the distance of that vector from the origin: $\|a\|\coloneqq d(a,0)$.

It turns out that this norm (and thus this metric) actually arises from a more fundamental structure, namely that of the **inner product**.
Returning to the bra-ket notation, we recall that the norm of any vector $\ket{a}$ is exactly $\|a\|=\sqrt{\braket{a}{a}}$, and thus the distance between any two vectors $\ket{a},\ket{b}$ is exactly $d(\ket{a},\ket{b})=\|\ket{b}-\ket{a}\|$ (though for simplicity we sometimes write this as $\|b-a\|$ instead).
This norm is also called the **$2$-norm**, or the **$\ell^2$-norm**, and is defined for any finite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^n$ using the fact that $\mathbb{C}\cong\mathbb{R}^2$, so that $\|x+iy\|\coloneqq\|(x,y)\|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.

Before moving on to talk about state vectors, let us first discuss one other metric space which shows up in information theory (both classical and quantum).
